Research work is organized into the following areas: administrative law, civil procedure law, commercial law, comparative law, criminal law, criminal procedure, economics, history of law, canon law, ecclesiastical law, history of political doctrines, international law, labour law, philosophy of law, private law, public law, Roman and antique law, sociological-juridical studies, European law, tax law, biolaw, environmental law, food law, constitutional law, sociology of law, deviance and social change.</p>\n\n<p>The Faculty offers a five-year <strong>Master\u2019s degree in Law</strong>, which includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>additional, advanced and specialization courses to improve teaching</li>\n\t<li>practical workshops</li>\n\t<li>annual programming of courses, to keep up with the current perspectives of European legal professionals</li>\n\t<li>international programmes and an international teaching staff</li>\n\t<li>international mobility opportunities for students</li>\n\t<li>courses aimed at improving language and IT skills</li>\n\t<li>internship opportunities, in Italy and abroad</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Faculty of Law is a member of the School of International Studies and participates in its <strong>interdisciplinary Master\u2019s programme in European and International Studies</strong>, which provides students with knowledge in economics, politics, sociology. This Master does not prepare for legal professions, but gives students an essential legal background to work in other sectors. It also participates, with a number of modules, in courses offered by the Departments of Economics and Management, Sociology and Social Research, Humanities and Engineering. The Faculty of Law has recently launched a three-year degree programme in <strong>Comparative, European and International Legal Studies</strong> (CEILS), whose main features are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the limited number of places available (50)</li>\n\t<li>English taught courses</li>\n\t<li>a strong focus on comparative law</li>\n\t<li>an international and transnational approach, in terms of language and contents, for both Italian and foreign students</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Faculty also offers, organizes and manages a <strong>Doctoral Programme in Comparative and European Legal Studies</strong>.</p>\n",
