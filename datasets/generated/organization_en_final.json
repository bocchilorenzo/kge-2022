Three projects, co-funded by the Autonomous Province of Trento, focus on institutional change, economic growth and social development (with special attention for the European and Chinese areas). Two projects, funded by MIUR and the University, are centred on the relationship between globalization, climate change and the use of natural resources (water, in particular).</p>\n\n<p>The School offers interdisciplinary education and specialization courses, entirely taught in English, to students who completed a three-year undergraduate degree, and is therefore the only \u201c<strong>Graduate School</strong>\u201d of International Studies in Italy. More precisely, the School organizes a Master's Degree in European and International Studies (Laura Magistrale in Studi Europei e Internazionali, MEIS), a Master's Degree in International Security Studies (Laura Magistrale in Studi sulla Sicurezza Internazionale - MISS) with Sant\u2019Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, and a three-year Doctoral programme in International Studies.</p>\n\n<p>The School collaborates with national and international research centres and think-tanks and with the University\u2019s departments and faculties. <strong>National and international academics are regularly invited to visit the School to give lectures</strong> and meet students. The School hosts weekly seminars on subjects pertaining to European and international studies and security, welcomes professional practitioners employed in important international organizations, promotes research conferences and workshops, organizes meetings to develop cross-sector skills (soft skills), contributes to the set up of the Summer school and to other dissemination events with other local, national and international research entities. Students, faculty members, post-doc researchers and visiting professors from all over the world take part in the School\u2019s teaching and research activities.</p>\n\n<p>The School of International Studies is honoured to have two distinguished Honorary Professors: Senator Giorgio Napolitano (former President of the Italian Republic) and Vaclav Klaus (former President of the Czech Republic).</p>\n",

Specific attention is devoted to theological studies and interreligious dialogue.</p>\n\n<p>In the area of <strong>history</strong>, research interests are focused on the <strong>history of institutions and public administration</strong>, <strong>social and communication structures</strong>, the i<strong>nteraction between history and culture</strong>. Particular interest is paid to the Alpine regions and the relationships between the Italian and Germanic worlds. From a more theoretical point of view, specific studies are dedicated to the means of disseminating the historical memory - at individual and collective levels - and to the relationship between historical research and political ideologies.</p>\n\n<p>In the area of cultural heritage, research activities focus on three main strands: <strong>archaeology, history of art, and music</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Language, Philology and Literature</h2>\n\n<p>Research in these areas focuses on texts and their contexts.</p>\n\n<p>As regards languages, the department fosters research in <strong>English, German, French, Russian, and Spanish</strong>, both from a <strong>historical</strong> point of view (the study of literature) and a <strong>synchronic</strong> point of view (the study of spoken languages).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Philology and literature</strong> are closely tied subjects, following the best Italian and European traditions. Research interests are divided in two main areas: the <strong>classical and medieval traditions</strong>, both Latin and vernacular, and <strong>contemporary literature</strong>, explored in a comparative and theoretical perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Two laboratories support research in these areas: one is devoted to the study of European cultural journals (<strong>CIRCE</strong>: Catalogo Informatico delle Riviste Culturali Europee), the other to contemporary poetry studies (<strong>SEMPER</strong>: Seminario Permanente di Poesia). Two journals are published by scholars working in this area: \u201cOsservatorio critico della germanistica\u201d (German studies) and \u201cTicontre\u201d (Theory, Text, Translation).</p>\n\n<p>The department has recently expanded its <strong>course offer</strong>, which now includes 4 undergraduate degrees and 9 master\u2019s degrees. Students also have the opportunity to participate in <strong>training and internship programmes</strong>, spend study periods in other European universities and take the <strong>double degree programme with the University of Dresden</strong>.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>The department promotes, coordinates and manages teaching and research in the area of humanities, and specifically in literature, linguistics, philology, philosophy, history and cultural heritage.<br />\nResearch in the Department of Humanities encompasses two areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>philosophy, history and cultural heritage</li>\n\t<li>language, philology and literature</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Philosophy, history and cultural heritage</h2>\n\n<p>Researchers in the area of philosophy study the history of <strong>philosophy, from the ancient world to contemporary philosophical issues</strong> and, with a more theoretical approach, examine issues pertaining to ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. Specific attention is devoted to theological studies and interreligious dialogue.</p>\n\n<p>In the area of <strong>history</strong>, research interests are focused on the <strong>history of institutions and public administration</strong>, <strong>social and communication structures</strong>, the i<strong>nteraction between history and culture</strong>. Particular interest is paid to the Alpine regions and the relationships between the Italian and Germanic worlds. From a more theoretical point of view, specific studies are dedicated to the means of disseminating the historical memory - at individual and collective levels - and to the relationship between historical research and political ideologies.</p>\n\n<p>In the area of cultural heritage, research activities focus on three main strands: <strong>archaeology, history of art, and music</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Language, Philology and Literature</h2>\n\n<p>Research in these areas focuses on texts and their contexts.</p>\n\n<p>As regards languages, the department fosters research in <strong>English, German, French, Russian, and Spanish</strong>, both from a <strong>historical</strong> point of view (the study of literature) and a <strong>synchronic</strong> point of view (the study of spoken languages).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Philology and literature</strong> are closely tied subjects, following the best Italian and European traditions. Research interests are divided in two main areas: the <strong>classical and medieval traditions</strong>, both Latin and vernacular, and <strong>contemporary literature</strong>, explored in a comparative and theoretical perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Two laboratories support research in these areas: one is devoted to the study of European cultural journals (<strong>CIRCE</strong>: Catalogo Informatico delle Riviste Culturali Europee), the other to contemporary poetry studies (<strong>SEMPER</strong>: Seminario Permanente di Poesia). Two journals are published by scholars working in this area: \u201cOsservatorio critico della germanistica\u201d (German studies) and \u201cTicontre\u201d (Theory, Text, Translation).</p>\n\n<p>The department has recently expanded its <strong>course offer</strong>, which now includes 4 undergraduate degrees and 9 master\u2019s degrees. Students also have the opportunity to participate in <strong>training and internship programmes</strong>, spend study periods in other European universities and take the <strong>double degree programme with the University of Dresden</strong>.</p>\n",
