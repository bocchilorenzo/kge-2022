As such, there is a need for effective and efficient solutions that will allow us to store, maintain, search and retrieve large volumes of data. This is what the data management systems do. The goal of this course is to teach the students the fundamental concepts of data  management, to train them in order to be able to design of good databases, give them the ability to build complex queries, and allow them to identify and solve performance problems in real life situations. \nNaturally the course focuses on relational databases since the relational model is the one that drives most of the existing data management systems in the industry nowadays, it has been around for more than 30 years and has been one of the most studied model, and has been the one with the most commercial tools in operation. \n",

Then, we introduce the more important approaches for image filtering and extraction of image descriptors. These concepts are further extended to deal with motion pictures. Finally, the problem of image compression is introduced, focusing on most known techniques for image and video coding, as well as their standard implementations. The approach of the course is rather practical, with the explanation of theoretical concept followed by their translation into algorithmic terms.",

This is the fundamental topic in Ecohydraulics, the discipline that focuses on the consequences of fluid and sediment processes on the organisms that inhabit aquatic environments. While still a young science, Ecohydraulics already endows the engineer with an overall understanding and quantitative tools to predict how physical processes shape habitat quality and quantity, and how, in turn, they are affected by ecological dynamics. This enables the integrated analysis of different management options for natural and man-made water bodies in terms of their ecosystem consequences. At the broadest scale, this class will contribute to the students' appreciation of the tight link between the natural and the built or impacted environment, and of the importance of considering both (and \u201chow-to\u201d) for harmonizing environmental quality with human river uses in river management and restoration.</p><p>At the end of the course the student will be able to: i) identify the different fluvial forms and their evolutionary trajectories; ii) use the hydro-morphological quality indexes and assess the status of alteration of river ecosystems; iii) understand the relations between hydro-morphology and biotic component, the causes of alteration of river ecosystems and tools to design ecological flow regimes in altered rivers; iv) appreciate the relevance of the integration of complementary disciplines for the sustainable management of water bodies.</p>",

        "description": "Learning objectives and expected achievements \n\nThe increasing religious and cultural differentiation going on in many European countries has brought about a renewed interest of the social sciences in the religious factor. Every religion makes law, that is, creates rules guiding its members, whose impact often goes beyond the merely ritual sphere, and which have effect also on public and social behavior as regards family, the workplace, education, social-economic life (prayers, feast days, school, food, slaughter, clothing and burials). \nThe knowledge of religious rules has a fundamental importance in order to understand the new Italian and European reality, which is more and more multireligious. Whereas each of these realities has been studied by scholars, the comparison among the various religious laws has been developed recently. Comparative law of religions links the study of the different religious laws, in order to identify analogies and differences. \nThe study of comparative law of religions is fundamental: a persons or a communitys religion creates problems of intersection and interference with the civil community, and each of these problems has originated heated controversies that have prompted the approval of laws and the enactment of judgments. As noted by Ferrari (2019), today religion has assumed a far more important legal relevance than in the past, and students dealing with law cannot allow themselves to ignore the rules regulating the behavior of the members of a religion, at the risk of a cultural and professional impoverishment. \nThe comparative method will allow students in the first place to know better each of the religious laws dealt with in the course, to understand and appreciate the links existing among them and, lastly, to answer the questions addressed by the different religious communities existing and co-existing in a country. Only in this way will students be able to develop the necessary ability to find a balance between the claims of the various religious groups present on the same territory, on the one side, and the smallest common denominator of values shared by citizens at large, on the other one, in a difficult operation of accommodation. \n\nAt the end of the course, students will be able: \n\n-to understand the normative content of Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Buddhist, and Hindu religions, and to distinguish the rules proper of religion, and those proper of tradition and/or culture,\n-to examine, also in comparative perspective, different institutes as regards in particular family law (marriage and successions),\n-to know the normative sources of the different religious laws,\n-to be able to order the social living together, that is, to elaborate, at least theoretically, instruments and strategies allowing to live within the contemporary religious and cultural diversity, limiting as far as possible tensions and conflicts,\n-to use the appropriate terminology.\n\n",

Legal topics and concepts are used in the course as vehicles to explore legal language. \n\nWhile a selection of legal terminology in each legal topic area is presented throughout the course, mastering legal English requires more than simply improving your knowledge of specialized vocabulary. \n\nBy the end of the course the students should have acquired a basic knowledge of the main features of legal English, aspects of specialized lexis; the importance of legal collocations and formal register, considering different degrees of formality in text types within the large genre of legal English.\n\nThe course is based on the assumption that, in order to profit from the mobility programs/exchanges available in foreign universities, the needs of the students lie predominantly in improving their speaking skills, in addition to listening and reading comprehension strategies; therefore an essential component of the course is learning to produce and deliver an effective oral presentation of a legal topic. \n\nDue to constraints of time, written production and in particular legal drafting is not prioritized, although there are opportunities during the course to practice formal letter-writing, such as emails of advice, replies to letters before action and letters of application/motivation, which are marked and feedback given.\n\nSpecific Learning Outcomes\n\nThis course is focused on improving your language skills at the B2 level. This course will:\nStrengthen speaking skills and enable students to engage more effectively in a range of speaking situations typical of the study of law and the practice of law, such as client interviews or discussions with colleagues and fellow students;\nImprove the ability to read, understand, and applying analyze a range of legal texts, such as legislation and legal correspondence;\nImprove comprehension of spoken English when it is used to speak about legal topics in lectures, presentations, interviews, and discussions appropriate to B2 level; and\nImprove the ability to write basic but accurate legal correspondence.\n\nStudents will also improve their abilities to:\nuse legal language confidently and accurately, based on the knowledge of collocations and specific lexis acquired over the course;\nmake appropriate choices in register, based on the knowledge acquired over the course; and\nuse a range of databases, online dictionaries and legal resources, including an introduction to using linguistic corpora.\n",

        "description": "Recently, the judiciary has been going through a phase of profound transformation that deserves to be analysed and discussed with the typical tools of the law. In particular, judicial function increasingly assumes a supranational dimension: national judge has also become \u201cEuropean judge\u201d and this inevitably has an effect on the concrete exercise of the function and on the very idea and culture of being a judge in contemporary society. At the same time, the judge has long since ceased to be \u201ca mere mouth of the law\u201d, to act as an alternative to the legislator in the production of law and in the identification and recognition of the always new social needs. \n\nAccordingly, the course aims to provide students with the theoretical and practical knowledge that will enable them to respond to some fundamental questions and to understand and know how to manage the dynamics of contemporary legal systems consciously and effectively. In particular, students will be able to critically address some core-issues not only in terms of the functioning of legal systems but also in terms of their future professionalization:\n\n1. the meaning, guarantees and limits of the independence and autonomy of the judiciary in contemporary societies;\n2. The role that the judge plays and should play in contemporary legal systems;\n3. The effectiveness of the independence and autonomy of judge and public prosecutor in a multi-level system (Constitution, ECHR, European Union) and the identification of a common core of guarantee principles and instruments;\n4. The main models of regulation of judicial systems existing at a comparative level and their compatibility with supranational and constitutional standards, with particular reference to the Italian one;\n5. The relationship between the type of organization of the judicial systems and the effectiveness of autonomy and independence of the judiciary, with particular reference to the different solutions that can be adopted regarding selection, internal organization, remuneration, career, responsibility of the judiciary (judges and prosecutors).\n\nAt the end of the course, students will have acquired an exhaustive picture of essential principles and dynamics on the discipline of judicial systems, starting from the supranational dimension, passing through the discussion of cases derived from comparative law, to reach the Italian constitutional level. The goal is to provide not only theoretical skills and knowledge but, taking advantage of the potentials of comparative method and the analysis of case-law, to offer a description of the effective implementation dynamics of the different systems analysed.\nIn particular, students will know:\na) to understand and evaluate critically and consciously the dynamics that arise between powers, in particular between legislative and judicial;\nb) to research and critically analyse principles which characterise the European and international framework (ECHR), with particular attention to the standards of guarantee of the rule of law and the autonomy and independence of the judge and public prosecutor;\nc) critically evaluate the different national models regarding judicial systems, also through the use of the comparative method;\nd) evaluate the Italian judicial system in the light of the comparative analysis carried out and the European parameters;\ne) know the reality of the Italian judicial system, in particular in order to allow a more conscious choice of the professional path to be taken after the degree;\nf) use a law study based on the \"Learning by doing\" and \"law in action analysis\" methods, also through dialogue with sector experts (professors and magistrates) who will participate in the lessons.\n",

        "description": "In the last few years, the cloud computing revolution heavily impacted the ICT world: cloud infrastructure, both public and private, hosts a significant portion of modern digital services and data. Cloud technologies and methodologies, such as virtualisation, containerisation, micro-service based architectures and service-meshes, are becoming prevalent among large technology providers, cloud operators and software developers. New software applications are, in turn, being developed following the so called cloud-native paradigm in order to exploit the benefits, such as scalability and reliability, offered by the cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nWithin this technological revolution, topics such as data locality and management are also attracting increasing interest. For this reason, one area of significant development in this space is that of edge computing resources, leading to the emergence of the fog computing paradigm. Indeed, more and more services are beginning to exploit, or even require, its benefits in terms of reduced latency, lower bandwidth consumption through near data source pre-processing, or simply guarantees around the geo-location of data.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to Cloud and Fog computing principles and technologies, following a practical, hands-on approach. More specifically, at the end of the course the student will: (1) learn about cloud and fog computing models, technologies and existing solutions; (2) acquire relevant knowledge on advanced topics related to networking, orchestration and security; (3) use and configure advanced open-source platforms to create and manage cloud computing infrastructures and to effectively and dynamically orchestrate workloads.",

Legal topics and concepts are used in the course as vehicles to explore legal language. \n\nWhile a selection of legal terminology in each legal topic area is presented throughout the course, mastering legal English requires more than simply improving your knowledge of specialized vocabulary. \n\nBy the end of the course the students should have acquired an enhanced knowledge of the main features of legal English, aspects of specialized lexis; the importance of legal collocations and formal register, considering different degrees of formality in text types within the large genre of legal English.\n\nThe course is based on the assumption that, in order to profit from the mobility programs/exchanges available in foreign universities, the needs of the students lie predominantly in improving their speaking skills, in addition to listening and reading comprehension strategies; therefore an essential component of the course is learning to produce and deliver an effective oral presentation of a legal topic. \n\nDue to constraints of time, written production and in particular legal drafting is not prioritized, although there are opportunities during the course to practice formal letter-writing, such as emails of advice, replies to letters before action and letters of application/motivation, which are marked and feedback given.\n\nSpecific Learning Outcomes\n\nThis course is focused on improving your language skills at the C1 level. This course will:\nStrengthen speaking skills and enable students to engage more effectively in a range of speaking situations typical of the study of law and the practice of law, such as client interviews or discussions with colleagues and fellow students;\nImprove the ability to read, understand, and applying analyze a range of legal texts, such as legislation and legal correspondence;\nImprove comprehension of spoken English when it is used to speak about legal topics in lectures, presentations, interviews, and discussions appropriate to C1 level; and\nImprove the ability to write basic but accurate legal correspondence.\n\nStudents will also improve their abilities to:\nuse legal language confidently and accurately, based on the knowledge of collocations and specific lexis acquired over the course;\nmake appropriate choices in register, based on the knowledge acquired over the course; and\nuse a range of databases, online dictionaries and legal resources, including an introduction to using linguistic corpora.\n",

The objective of the course is providing to the students concepts, approaches and techniques for the analysis, the design, and the development of the software. In particular, the course will focus on process models, modelling languages and verification and validation techniques. Moreover, diagrammatic languages, requirements analysis methods, design principles and testing techniques will allow the students to design high quality software. The students will be practicing by developing and implementing a web service applying the most modern development techniques, including the adoption of RESTful directives and the use of standard languages for the documentation of web APIs, the collaboration in the development of the source code in a central repository, the automation of code testing, and the configuration of services and tools to set-up a continuous integration process for the software. Finally, project management concepts and metrics for software products will be introduced.\n\nEXPECTED RESULTS\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to: \n1. define the most suitable development process and model for the analysis and the design of the software under consideration; \n2. represent with the different types of diagrams the requirements, the architecture, the intarction among the components, and the deployment of the system; \n3. define and mange in a consistent and complete way the functional and non functional requirements of a software system highlighting priorities and criticises. \n4.

The goal of this course is to teach the students the fundamental concepts of data  management, to train them in order to be able to design of good databases, give them the ability to build complex queries, and allow them to identify and solve performance problems in real life situations. \nNaturally the course focuses on relational databases since the relational model is the one that drives most of the existing data management systems in the industry nowadays, it has been around for more than 30 years and has been one of the most studied model, and has been the one with the most commercial tools in operation. \n",

Legal topics and concepts are used in the course as vehicles to explore legal language. \n\nWhile a selection of legal terminology in each legal topic area is presented throughout the course, mastering legal English requires more than simply improving your knowledge of specialized vocabulary. \n\nBy the end of the course the students should have acquired an enhanced knowledge of the main features of legal English, aspects of specialized lexis; the importance of legal collocations and formal register, considering different degrees of formality in text types within the large genre of legal English.\n\nThe course is based on the assumption that, in order to profit from the mobility programs/exchanges available in foreign universities, the needs of the students lie predominantly in improving their speaking skills, in addition to listening and reading comprehension strategies; therefore an essential component of the course is learning to produce and deliver an effective oral presentation of a legal topic. \n\nDue to constraints of time, written production and in particular legal drafting is not prioritized, although there are opportunities during the course to practice formal letter-writing, such as emails of advice, replies to letters before action and letters of application/motivation, which are marked and feedback given.\n\nSpecific Learning Outcomes\n\nThis course is focused on improving your language skills at the C1 level. This course will:\nStrengthen speaking skills and enable students to engage more effectively in a range of speaking situations typical of the study of law and the practice of law, such as client interviews or discussions with colleagues and fellow students;\nImprove the ability to read, understand, and applying analyze a range of legal texts, such as legislation and legal correspondence;\nImprove comprehension of spoken English when it is used to speak about legal topics in lectures, presentations, interviews, and discussions appropriate to C1 level; and\nImprove the ability to write basic but accurate legal correspondence.\n\nStudents will also improve their abilities to:\nuse legal language confidently and accurately, based on the knowledge of collocations and specific lexis acquired over the course;\nmake appropriate choices in register, based on the knowledge acquired over the course; and\nuse a range of databases, online dictionaries and legal resources, including an introduction to using linguistic corpora.\n",

Applied Ecology includes natural resource conservation, natural flora and fauna management, water resource management, pest management, pollution and ecotoxycology, natural landscape change, climate change and global warming. Applied ecology and biodiversity study are profoundly intertwined, both in the monitoring phases and in the management choices. The recent and far past clearly shows that technical and engineering choices cannot ignore environmental and ecological sustainability, to avoid the repetition of dramatic disasters like desertification of vast areas, river rectification, Vajont, Stava, Lambro and Danube poisoning, radioactive poisoning in north and south Germany, Tchernobyl and Fukushima, plastic and micro-plastic sea and soil pollution. All these disasters will result in huge costs in environmental, economical terms and they will often directly affect local population health condition. The major causes of the current important economic crisis are due to an environmental crisis that lead to a lack of resources exacerbated by human induced Climate change. This picture was generated by overexploitation and inefficiency in the use of natural resources, caused by the underestimation of the consequences of environmental problems to ecosystem services in an holistic vision. The course will deal with the environments in temperate and boreal climates and with the tropical and subtropical regions. The course will deal with theoretical fundamental elements and practical examples to understand Applied Ecology, giving hints about future developments of this science. Among the topics treated in the course: Ecocertification, biomonitoring, Biosensors, GIS, dynamic landscape modeling, definition of criteria for protected areas planning and management. Species distribution models and prediction of future landscape change with Markov Chains and Cellular automata will be treated. Seminars held by experts and visits to Applied Ecology offices will be organized. The students shall be able to apply Applied Ecology knowledge to understand the consequences of anthropic disturbance on environment and ecosystems. They shall be able to know monitoring field and modeling tools that can help the management of applied ecology. The students will be requested to write an original research paper treating and analyzing a specific topic in a critical perspective.</p>",

        "description": "The conduct of civil litigation presents fundamental similarities in any developed legal system. Every civil case involves a complaining party who seeks a remedy from a court for an asserted legal wrong against a defending party, who generally contests what the former asserts. The jurisdictional court must be and remain neutral and impartial between the conflicting parties, and is entrusted with the function of deciding the case, according to established legal rules. In light of recognised principles of fairness, the court has to hear both sides of the dispute. After the presentation of the case by the parties, the court must decide it, and render an ultimate decision (adjudication). This decision is subject to appellate review by a higher court. Due to the need for legal certainty, appellate review is generally limited and will result in a definitive conclusion which is thereafter binding on the parties (res judicata). If the losing party does not voluntary comply with the decision, it may be enforced by the prevailing party (judgment enforcement).\nWhile these characteristics of a civil dispute are essentially the same in any developed legal system, various systems present significantly different approaches to civil litigation, especially comparing Civil Law and Common Law traditions or, better said, virtually all legal systems, on the one hand, and the US system, on the other hand.\nExploring these differences in a comparative perspective has increasingly become indispensable for anyone who is required to participate in civil litigation, and especially when civil litigation results in transnational litigation, that is, civil litigation presenting connections with various legal systems.\nThis course offers essential expertise on how to approach and resolve cross-border civil litigation in the world-wide judicial arena. In particular, at the end of the course students will be able to recognize:\n-what the various in-court proceedings are designed to accomplish, and the issues that will have to be resolved in them;\n-the main stages of in-court proceedings in the various systems;\n-the reasons why legal systems respond differently to similar procedural issues and, in particular, the impact of the historical, social and economic context of a legal system on the rules and structure of its in-court proceedings;\n-the most significant similarities and differences between in-court proceedings of Civil and Common Law traditions; and\n-whether and how harmonization or unification of different procedures in the various legal systems is possible and/or desirable in a global context.\n",

This is based on the idea that learning happens when theoretical notions are accompanied by skills development and the ability to apply knowledge. \nCore principles of copyright law will be plainly explained (e.g. the notion of originality, the idea/expression dichotomy, etc.). Furthermore, by means of an interdisciplinary and practical approach students will learn that copyright law is changing, as it is instrumental to the pursuit of certain social, economic or ethical aims. They also will experience that the evolution of copyright law is closely linked to technological changes as well as to developing business models. \nAt the end of the course, students will know the most important elements charactering the regulation of copyright law and be able:\n\u2022\tto critically analyze such elements;\n\u2022\tto apply rules to specific legal issues;\n\u2022\tto read and understand decisions of national, European and North American courts;\n\u2022\tto read and understand contracts in the field of copyright law; \n\u2022\tto think logically and clearly;\n\u2022\tto communicate effectively orally and in writing;\n\u2022\tto apply a sound methodology for acquiring and using information from many sources;\n\u2022\tto work collaboratively.\n",

        "description": "\u201cLet us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\u201d \nJohn F. Kennedy\n\nNegotiations are an essential and fundamental moment in the life of individuals, organizations, institutions, and firms. In the last few decades, negotiation has moved from the industrial relations and political arena to the forefront of managerial interest. Negotiation, bargaining, and mediation traditionally refer to the arbitration of disputes between labour and management. However, scholars and practitioners now recognise that these skills operate in virtually every management function, including strategy formulation, mergers and acquisitions, purchasing, sales, international development and many others.\n\nNegotiation is a common mechanism for resolving differences between and allocating resources among exchange partners such as supervisors, colleagues, corporate entities and even nations. Improving negotiation skills, as well as increasing the ability to negotiate effectively, is crucial in managerial, political, and business contexts.\nThis module explores the key aspects of negotiation. The primary aim of this module is to integrate negotiation theory and practice, through an integration of concepts, models, expertise and practical experience. It will typically examine, through a mix of theory and practice, the links among negotiation fundamentals, negotiation sub-processes and negotiation contexts.\n\nLearning objectives\n\nThe purpose of this course is threefold. \n\u2022\tThe first is to explore the major concepts and theories of negotiation, as well as the dynamics of interpersonal and intergroup conflict and its resolution. This will entail material about the structural (e.g. parties, issues, positions and interest) and process-oriented (cognitive, interactional) dynamics that are necessary for a sound critical background. \n\u2022\tThe second objective is to develop skills relevant to a broad range of applied contexts. This involves direct training in identifying crucial elements of a negotiation situation and implementing appropriate resolution strategies. \n\u2022\tThe third objective is to encourage participants to assume a \u201creflective\u201d and \u201ccooperative\u201d posture about negotiations specifically and social influence broadly. \n\nOn completion of the module you should be able to:\n\n\u2022\tAnalyse a negotiation situation and its possible solutions.\n\u2022\tIdentify the personal challenges we all have in dealing with negotiation.\n\u2022\tApply complex theory and practice of negotiation in particular and general contexts.\n",

Modern robots assist older adults or  impaired people, work side by side with human workers, drive on the highways with little or no assistance. This paradigm shift requires the robot to perceive and understand the situation in the surroundings, to autonomously plan a suitable course of actions for a task, and to see to its correct execution by properly reacting to unexpected events. \nTo design a machine of this complexity, engineers need several competencies tapping diverse disciplines. Robots are physical machines created by humans, so their motion can be analysed and controlled through appropriate mathematical models. Robots move in a partially known environment, so they need to create a map of their surroundings, to localise themselves within the environment, to detect, classify and recognise the different objects they interact with. Robots are required to be autonomous or sem-iautonomous, so they need the ability to decide a sequence of actions (a plan), to implement it within appropriate safety bounds and to adapt it to changes as needed. Finally, robots embed computing machines that need to be programmed through appropriate languages and frameworks. \nThe students will be introduced to each one of these different aspects and will receive the opportunity to put them into practice using our advanced educational laboratories and teaching facilities. After taking the course, they will be able to take on a career as developers of robotic applications and/or to continue with advanced studies in the area of intelligent robots.",

In this course the fundamentals of infinitesimal calculus are introduce and studied: limits, continuity, differentiation, integration of one-variable functions. The course starts describing the historical evolution of numerical systems, showing that every extension was motivated by the need to solve more and more complex problems.  Mathematics is presented as matter in evolution, showing that some of the progress required centuries. Also the subsequent part of the course is presented by successive extensions, motivating the definitions and rigorously proving the fundamental theorems. The lectures are followed by exercise sessions, where problems related to the lectures subject are solved by elementary techniques. \nAt the course end, the student is able to deal with the course subjects critically and rigorously, and has the mathematical background necessary for successive courses.\n",

Hoffmann, taken from the collection Die Serapions-Br\u00fcder (1819-1821). An intellectual biography of the author will be outlined, his way of constructing the story and the main narrative techniques will be analysed. The historical-cultural background, by which every literary phenomenon is conditioned, will be also taken into consideration (Napoleon\u2019s campaigns, the victories of the French troops, the defeat of Prussia, the Restoration), as well as the cultural \u2018discourses\u2019 which were widespread at the time of the composition of the story (Naturphilosophie, animal magnetism, clairvoyance, telepathy, mesmerism, electrology, studies on sleepwalking, hypnosis).

Students are also expected to develop their communication skills (e.g. to be able to intervene in a discussion, to be able to ask questions to the teacher, to be able to share their work with their classmates, to be able to synthesise and present the knowledge acquired) and an effective method to consolidate the acquired knowledge.",

In terms of judgement, the course will predominantly focus on the heuristics and biases approach, and in particular its new interpretation within dual process theories. Students will learn that many of our judgements do not involve deliberate thought or reasoning, as standard economic theory assumes, but rather are based on intuition. In terms of decision-making, students will learn about prospect theory that aims to describe how people decide rather than how they ought to decide. For example, you will learn how the framing of a choice (whether the outcomes are described in terms of gains or losses) can have a big impact on decisions. In turn, all these theories and concepts will be related to consumer judgement.\nBy the end of the course students should have acquired:\n-an in-depth understanding of psychological research on judgement and decision making, and its relevance for understanding consumer judgement and choice. This includes the ability to summarise the theories and define their central concepts.\n-the ability to critically evaluate the theories in light of empirical evidence.\n-the ability to read journal articles, discuss the main theoretical points and findings, and to critically evaluate the theories.\n\n",

Economic psychology, therefore, describes and explains economic preferences and choices, and factors influencing these. The focus of economic psychology is to understand human (and organizational) motivations behind economic decisions, such as consumer decisions, investment decisions, negotiations, savings, tax compliance and insurance decisions.\nEconomics deals also with the behavior of humans and hence should be considered as a behavioral science. It is mainly concerned with prescribing what economic agents should do, what they should choose, in order to maximize their personal outcomes (i.e., to be rational). Two broad theories of rational choice can be identified, Utility Theory has been proposed to understand individual decision making and Game Theory has been proposed to understand the behavior of individuals in interdependent situations. Psychologists and experimental economists have studied whether and how utility theory and game theory describe and predict the behavior of individuals. It appears that people systematically violate the assumptions of these theories. Therefore, in order to come to a better understanding of human behavior, a new approach that takes these violations into account should be developed. In this course we discuss these behavioral violations and the suggested alternative theories to economic behavior.\nIn this course you will:\n\tdevelop an understanding of differences between major theories and research practices in economics and psychology.\n\tlearn when and why economic theories fail descriptively, and what alternative explanations for economic behavior have been proposed. \n\tapply these ideas and findings to the formulation of solutions to real-life problems (e.g., problems in consumer choice, marketing, or questions of public policy)\n\tgive a reasoned opinion of fundamental issues and debates on economic decision- making discussed during the lectures (e.g., freedom to choose, rationality, self-interest, fairness).\n",

A knowledge of the details of the procedures and the effectiveness of constitutional decisions brings with it the awareness of the role of constitutional justice in defining the rules to be applied daily and in outlining the real physiognomy, in action, of the legal system. The study in detail of the subject therefore intends to bring the figure of the constitutional judge closer to the student, as an actor whose intervention is of interest to any legal operator, even to those who do not come into direct contact with the Court.\nIn addition to examining technical-specialist profiles not covered in institutional courses, the course also aims to provide a modern and dynamic vision of the \"constitutional adjudication\", to underline its changes in the context of increasingly multi-level rights protection systems and of a system of sources of law transfigured by complex international and supranational relations. In the last part of the course we will therefore analyze, starting from concrete cases, the dialogue that the Italian constitutional judge has established with foreign, international and supranational jurisdictions; analysis that aims to provide the student with the tools for a better awareness of the logic and the ways in which our jurisdiction is part of a wider remedial system, with an European and international dimension.\n",

The approach is data-driven, i.e. we will introduce only the theory necessary for the analysis of real datasets. At the end of the course the student is expected to be able to (i) estimate a multiple time series regression model and interpret the results; (ii) predict a time series by means of an appropriate forecasting method and interpret the results; (iii) master the R software.\nMy main goal in teaching this class consists in transmitting to the students the belief that apparently complicated statistical techniques are not only mathematical sophistications, but also tools with a tremendous impact in practical applications, and that they are important assets for professional success. In my opinion, a manager who masters complex statistical methods has a better understanding of the processes and projects going on in an organization.\nI am convinced that the most effective way of learning quantitative methods is based on problem solving. Accordingly, I will assign regular homeworks that have a threefold advantage:\n1. they mimick a situation that the students will often encounter in their career: they will have to solve a problem within a deadline;\n2. they encourage group work: even though the students will be individually responsible for the solution, hopefully they will realize that working together can produce a better result in a shorter time;\n3. they will give the students a motivation for a thorough understanding of the methods presented in class.",

This last aspect is essential to help students to enter the world of work. It will be accomplished thanks to the partnership with an expert operating in the civil engineering sector, in particular in the building of mega-structures, tensile structures, and retractable construction systems.

The complexity of multi-agent systems has led to the definition of different development methodologies, software architectures and programming languages \u200b\u200bin which the concept of agent assumes a key role as well as the concept of object-oriented object-oriented design. The objective of the course is to examine and explore the credentials of agent-based approaches as a software engineering paradigm, and to gain an insight into what agent-oriented software engineering will look like. We will present agent-oriented analysis, design and implementation techniques. In particular, the course will deal with the agent concept and the development of multi-agent systems, architectures and algorithms for agent software design, planning principles, modeling techniques and goal-oriented analysis, communication languages \u200b\u200band agent-oriented software engineering methodologies. We will also present single and multi-agent planning techniques. \n\nExpected learning results\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to: \n1.\tDefine the most appropriate agent-oriented development process and model for the analysis, design and implementation of a multi-agent system;\n2.\tadopt the TROPOS methodology at different stages of the development of a multi-agent system;\n3.\tadopt the most appropriate architecture for the development of a software agent (reactive, deliberative, hybrid, multi-level, BDI);\n4.\tDevelop a goal-oriented model as a deliberative model of a BDI agent and define its control loop;\n5.\tUse the PDDL language to specify a planning problem and find its solutions using the backbox planner;\n6.\tDefine the communication between two or more software agents using the basic constructs of the speech-act theory;\n7.\tDevelop multi-agent systems \n",

The aim is to allow us to understand natural phenomena, business operations and human behaviors, in ways that it will allow us to turn this knowledge into predictions, forecasting and performance improvements. The goal of the course is to introduce the students to the basic concepts, principles and techniques of Data Mining, to help them develop the required skills for using the state of the art data mining algorithms for solving practical problems, and to provide them with the required experience that will later allow them to operate independently, efficiently and effectively, in highly competitive markets. The course aims also to support students wishing to pursue a research carrier by teaching them the methodologies in performing independent and effective studies and research activities. The goals of the course will be achieved by teaching the students the strengths and limitations of the various data mining techniques, how they can be applied, under what conditions and what they should expect from each application. At the end of the course, the students will be finding themselves familiar with the most popular data mining concepts and will be able to identify and use the right solutions for any data analysis problem they may find themselves into. Last but not least, future data scientists will also learn how to perform the right experiments, how to interpret the results correctly and how to present them in the most effective way. ",

It introduces remote sensing methodologies, technologies and techniques that are fundamental for the design of the above-mentioned systems with the last generation of optical and radar sensors. It describes the approach to the design and implementation of systems for several applications and operative scenarios, including the design criteria for the choice of the sensors, the system architecture and data analysis techniques complementary to more general artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques presented in other mandatory courses.\nThere is a large part of the course that is common to all the students and another part (section 2) for which each attendee can select one between two modules: Module a) basics concepts in remote sensing and technologies for the acquisition of optical and radar images; or Module b) advanced concepts and design criteria for Earth observation and planetary exploration satellite missions. It is suggested that students that have not attended any basic remote sensing course follow Module a) while the others select Module b).\nThe theoretical lectures are complemented by practical examples on real systems including laboratory activities.\n\n",

Economic psychology, therefore, describes and explains economic preferences and choices, and factors influencing these. The focus of economic psychology is to understand human (and organizational) motivations behind economic decisions, such as consumer decisions, investment decisions, negotiations, savings, tax compliance and insurance decisions.\nEconomics deals also with the behavior of humans and hence should be considered as a behavioral science. It is mainly concerned with prescribing what economic agents should do, what they should choose, in order to maximize their personal outcomes (i.e., to be rational). Two broad theories of rational choice can be identified, Utility Theory has been proposed to understand individual decision making and Game Theory has been proposed to understand the behavior of individuals in interdependent situations. Psychologists and experimental economists have studied whether and how utility theory and game theory describe and predict the behavior of individuals. It appears that people systematically violate the assumptions of these theories. Therefore, in order to come to a better understanding of human behavior, a new approach that takes these violations into account should be developed. In this course we discuss these behavioral violations and the suggested alternative theories to economic behavior.\nIn this course you will:\n\tdevelop an understanding of differences between major theories and research practices in economics and psychology.\n\tlearn when and why economic theories fail descriptively, and what alternative explanations for economic behavior have been proposed. \n\tapply these ideas and findings to the formulation of solutions to real-life problems (e.g., problems in consumer choice, marketing, or questions of public policy)\n\tgive a reasoned opinion of fundamental issues and debates on economic decision- making discussed during the lectures (e.g., freedom to choose, rationality, self-interest, fairness).\n",

        "description": "Intellectual property (IP) and competition policy issues are increasingly relevant to undertakings, especially to those facing dynamic markets in an international environment. The course aims at providing students with solid theoretical and practical foundations in dealing with the legal facets of managing innovation. Both intellectual property law and competition policy can be said to pursue, by different means, the same primary aim of stimulating the innovation process. On the one hand, by allowing innovators to appropriate the results of their investments, incentives are created to take risks and engage in innovation activities. Competitive markets, on the other hand, allow for new products and services to emerge and be tested by consumers and/or other undertakings. However, as long as intellectual property rights (IPRs), like in particular patents and copyrights, are considered plain monopolies, there is arguably an inherent tension between the two above mentioned legal fields, in particular where such monopoly rights granted to creators and inventors stifle growth because of poorly designed \u201cincentives\u201d rules. \nIn this vein, it is especially the role of IPRs as tools to motivate firms to invest in innovation activities that has been seriously questioned in the last two decades. The case for further and general strengthening of IPRs appears weak, and it is increasingly understood that a new balance needs to be struck between rewarding risk-takers and diffusing new knowledge. This course examines the interface between intellectual property and competition law, looking in particular at how competition law is already affecting intellectual property. Moreover, the course is aimed at analyzing the peculiarities of the legal management of the intellectual assets of firms acting in different economic sectors (e.g., fashion industry, information and communication technology markets, pharmaceutical industry). \nOn completing this course, students will be able to: \na) clearly identify those contexts in which innovation management decisions are influenced by intellectual property law and competition policy considerations\nb) explain, in an interdisciplinary way, the core principles of intellectual property and competition law \nc) employ general analysis skills helping them to identify crucial issues and therefore to ask the right questions in the management and expansion of the firm's intellectual (property) assets\nd) understand and follow international trends in the area of IPRs and competition policy especially relevant to dynamic industries (e.g., so called \u201csearch bias\u201d as investigated by competition authorities on both sides of the Atlantic and its possible meaning and effects for other undertakings active in markets affected by such practices).\n",

Training objectives\nThe financial statement is the basis of the corporate information system. It highlights wealth production under different profiles: the financial, economic and equity profiles. The values related to the production of wealth derive from a common language: the double entry system. However, different accounting systems give rise to different values.\nThe course aims are as follows: \n1)to provide students with a basic knowledge of the double entry logic in order to understand where the items of the financial statement originate; \n2)to analyse some of the main issues of the evaluation in an international comparative key; \n3)to provide students with tools to read and understand the financial statement in critical terms, taking into account the differences in the different accounting systems; \n4)to enable the student to understand the purposes and limits of the financial statement.\nThe first part of the course is aimed at recalling the logic of the double entry system;  the second part focuses on reading, analysing and understanding the financial statement in critical terms; and the third part of the course is devoted to evaluation issues.\n\n2. Expected learning outcomes\nAt the end of the course, the student should be able to\n1) Understand the logic of the double entry system; \n2) Understand how the differences in valuation resulting from different accounting systems affect the results of the financial statements;\n3) Understand and be able to analyse and interpret the financial statements of companies of different typology and size;\n4) Identify critical accounting issues, and formulate them in a clear and structured manner;\n5) Elaborate on and propose, in contribution with the critical reflections of a working group, alternatives to the business information system that are aimed at widening the informative potential of the financial statement beyond the mandatory limits defined by law.\n\n",

Practical examples concerning real device commonly used for microwave systems will corroborate the theoretical concepts. In particular, the course provides the students with the methodologies necessary for the analysis and the design of complex microwave devices, starting from simple microwave devices like attenuators and filters up to complex active devices like microwave generators. This kind of knowledge is of great importance for telecommunication engineers involved in the development of telecommunication systems. All telecommunication products or systems require wired structures in order to work properly. In the course the basics concepts of the wired propagation and a working knowledge will be given. At the end of the course the student will be able to design and fabricate complex microwave device for low power as well as for high power. The didactic content of the course will be integrated with some software and experimental activities related to the study of electromagnetic propagation. Moreover, the standard microwave measurements methodologies will be explained.",

Since the 1980s and the end of the Cold War, academic interest in popular involvement in political life and the ideas and development of a 'global civil society' has grown. This module will consider the historical origins of global civil society, diverse and competing contemporary meanings of global civil and \u2018uncivil\u2019 society, and what \u2018global civil society\u2019 might look like in terms of actors, the relationships among them, and notions of legitimacy and power. Case studies will allow students to further reflect on these issues and the relationship of global civil society in its different manifestations to global institutions, forces of globalization, states and individuals. Fundamental questions addressed concern how global civil society impacts global (and regional) governance.\n\nUpon completion of this module students are expected to have acquired the following: \n\n1)\tAn understanding of different theoretical approaches to global civil society.\n2)\tKnowledge of a variety of global civil society campaigns.\n3)\tThe ability to recognise how non-state global civil society actors exert power at different territorial levels and on different themes through their strategies.\n4)\tAn understanding of critical views of global civil society.\n5)\tAn overview of how global civil society, and scholarly work about global civil society, has evolved and changed over time.\n\nIn addition, students who successfully complete this module should gain the following transferable skills:\n\n6)\tThe ability to learn independently and to assume responsibility for the learning process.\n7)\tBroad academic skills in the areas of critical reading and analysis, library and online research, note-taking and time management.\n8)\tConfidence in participating respectfully in class discussion and dialogue.\n9)\tSkills in written academic argument and confidence in crafting academic papers of an appropriate standard of written academic English.\n10)\tUnderstanding of issues relating to academic research \u2013 evaluating research sources, research methodologies, citation of research materials, management of materials and the avoidance of plagiarism and intellectual dishonesty.",

The goal of the course is to introduce the students to the basic concepts, principles and techniques of Data Mining, to help them develop the required skills for using the state of the art data mining algorithms for solving practical problems, and to provide them with the required experience that will later allow them to operate independently, efficiently and effectively, in highly competitive markets. The course aims also to support students wishing to pursue a research carrier by teaching them the methodologies in performing independent and effective studies and research activities. The goals of the course will be achieved by teaching the students the strengths and limitations of the various data mining techniques, how they can be applied, under what conditions and what they should expect from each application. At the end of the course, the students will be finding themselves familiar with the most popular data mining concepts and will be able to identify and use the right solutions for any data analysis problem they may find themselves into. Last but not least, future data scientists will also learn how to perform the right experiments, how to interpret the results correctly and how to present them in the most effective way. ",

The course aims at providing students with solid theoretical and practical foundations in dealing with the legal facets of managing innovation. Both intellectual property law and competition policy can be said to pursue, by different means, the same primary aim of stimulating the innovation process. On the one hand, by allowing innovators to appropriate the results of their investments, incentives are created to take risks and engage in innovation activities. Competitive markets, on the other hand, allow for new products and services to emerge and be tested by consumers and/or other undertakings. However, as long as intellectual property rights (IPRs), like in particular patents and copyrights, are considered plain monopolies, there is arguably an inherent tension between the two above mentioned legal fields, in particular where such monopoly rights granted to creators and inventors stifle growth because of poorly designed \u201cincentives\u201d rules. \nIn this vein, it is especially the role of IPRs as tools to motivate firms to invest in innovation activities that has been seriously questioned in the last two decades. The case for further and general strengthening of IPRs appears weak, and it is increasingly understood that a new balance needs to be struck between rewarding risk-takers and diffusing new knowledge. This course examines the interface between intellectual property and competition law, looking in particular at how competition law is already affecting intellectual property. Moreover, the course is aimed at analyzing the peculiarities of the legal management of the intellectual assets of firms acting in different economic sectors (e.g., fashion industry, information and communication technology markets, pharmaceutical industry). \nOn completing this course, students will be able to: \na) clearly identify those contexts in which innovation management decisions are influenced by intellectual property law and competition policy considerations\nb) explain, in an interdisciplinary way, the core principles of intellectual property and competition law \nc) employ general analysis skills helping them to identify crucial issues and therefore to ask the right questions in the management and expansion of the firm's intellectual (property) assets\nd) understand and follow international trends in the area of IPRs and competition policy especially relevant to dynamic industries (e.g., so called \u201csearch bias\u201d as investigated by competition authorities on both sides of the Atlantic and its possible meaning and effects for other undertakings active in markets affected by such practices).\n",

        "description": "<p>At a time in which humans have significantly affected the natural environment and yet society increasingly values the many services of natural ecosystems, accounting for ecological processes in engineering design is a major contemporary challenge for environmental engineers. This is the fundamental topic in Ecohydraulics, the discipline that focuses on the consequences of fluid and sediment processes on the organisms that inhabit aquatic environments. While still a young science, Ecohydraulics already endows the engineer with an overall understanding and quantitative tools to predict how physical processes shape habitat quality and quantity, and how, in turn, they are affected by ecological dynamics. This enables the integrated analysis of different management options for natural and man-made water bodies in terms of their ecosystem consequences. At the broadest scale, this class will contribute to the students' appreciation of the tight link between the natural and the built or impacted environment, and of the importance of considering both (and \u201chow-to\u201d) for harmonizing environmental quality with human river uses in river management and restoration.</p><p>At the end of the course the student will be able to: i) identify the different fluvial forms and their evolutionary trajectories; ii) use the hydro-morphological quality indexes and assess the status of alteration of river ecosystems; iii) understand the relations between hydro-morphology and biotic component, the causes of alteration of river ecosystems and tools to design ecological flow regimes in altered rivers; iv) appreciate the relevance of the integration of complementary disciplines for the sustainable management of water bodies.</p>",

        "description": "The vision fostered by the Internet of Things (IoT) rests on the ability to establish untethered and opportunistic communication among devices deployed in the environment or attached to people or other moving entities. Therefore, low-power wireless communication technologies, which remove altogether the need for wires, are a key enabler of IoT. The last few years witnessed a surge of these technologies, striking different tradeoffs in terms of range, data rate, power consumption as well as additional capabilities like distance\nestimation. These technologies enable a plethora of applications, e.g., monitoring and control of physical phenomena (wireless sensor networks) or smart environments where users are automatically localized and able to\nopportunistically interact with objects.\n\nThe course aims at providing students with a first-hand introduction to this exciting field; this is achieved through a synergy of theory and practice.\n\nTraditional classroom lectures will concisely present the salient aspects of several low-power wireless technologies, with an emphasis on wireless sensor networks (a key enabler of many IoT scenarios) and focusing primarily on the networking stack. Instead, laboratory sessions will be the opportunity for students to experiment \"hands-on\" with some of the technologies illustrated in the lectures, and understand their peculiarity.\n\nBy the end of the course, students are expected to have obtained a broad understanding of the key challenges in low-power wireless networking for the IoT, of the state-of-the-art solutions and associated trade-offs, as well as to have acquired the ability to autonomously design relatively simple IoT system components and applications on popular hw/sw platforms.",

Particular attention will be paid to two crucial historical and historiographical problems: a) the political motivations and objectives of the revolt; b) the incorporation of the various communities and the eventual unification of Roman Italy. Students are expected to learn thoroughly the historical events from mid-2nd century B.C. onward in their correct chronological development; at the end of the course, they will be able to: 1) make a proper use of the different sources and documents; 2) explore and reconstruct historical processes and phenomena with adequate methodological awareness; 3) understand both the political context and the social background of the historical events considered.</p>",

These methods will be first studied in theory, and then implemented in simulation (with the Python language) to gain practical experience.\nAttention will be also paid to illustrate the most common non idealities and issues that are present when controlling robots. The course will adopt a combination of simulation models and lab experiences to consolidate the knowledge transmitted during the theoretical lessons.\nAfter completing the course, students will be able to:\n- select the most suitable sensors and actuators for a given robotic application\n- model the kinematics and dynamics any kind of robot\n- understand the working principles of several control algorithms for robotic systems\n- choose the appropriate approach(es) to control a specific system for a given target application\n- implement, tune, and test control algorithms with the Python language",

Ample space will be given to reading texts of some of the chief characters of the Scientific Revolution, paying specific attention to the works of Kepler and Galileo \u2013 two contemporaries who gave major contributions to scientific thought, but had a very different understanding of the very science they were practicing.\nSpecial attention will be paid to the reading of the \u201cdialogue\u201d that took place between them, through their letters and works, particularly Kepler\u2019s Dissertatio (1610) and Narratio (1611). Texts will be read against the scientific, historic, intellectual and religious background of the early decades of the 17th century, and in the light of the contribution of the authors\u2019 contemporaries.\nThe second part of the course will be devoted to Galileo\u2019s Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems (1632), one of the most important scientific works of the early modern period. We will consider what came before the Dialogue, and what were the consequences of its publication: the trial, the sentence, the abjuration, and how the events affected the practice of science in Italy.\nAt the end of the course, students will have acquired a detailed knowledge (i.e. based on the actual reading of the original texts, and not merely on the historical reconstruction of their contents) of the debate on the nature, aim, and scope of early modern science.\nStudents are expected to be able:\n\u2014 to understand the ways in which the very idea of science has evolved, and what characterizes in throughout its many transformations;\n\u2014 to read and understand, in its original language or in translation, the works of some of the key protagonists of the Scientific Revolutions;\n\u2014 to consult specialized works in the history of science;\n\u2014 to deliver a presentation that develops a specific subject referred to in the course;\n\u2014 to take an oral examination on the subjects presented at the course, discussing specific passages and putting them in their proper context.",

Then, we introduce the more important approaches for image filtering and extraction of image descriptors. These concepts are further extended to deal with motion pictures. Finally, the problem of image compression is introduced, focusing on most known techniques for image and video coding, as well as their standard implementations. The approach of the course is rather practical, with the explanation of theoretical concept followed by their translation into algorithmic terms.",

The complexity of multi-agent systems has led to the definition of different development methodologies, software architectures and programming languages \u200b\u200bin which the concept of agent assumes a key role as well as the concept of object-oriented object-oriented design. The objective of the course is to examine and explore the credentials of agent-based approaches as a software engineering paradigm, and to gain an insight into what agent-oriented software engineering will look like. We will present agent-oriented analysis, design and implementation techniques. In particular, the course will deal with the agent concept and the development of multi-agent systems, architectures and algorithms for agent software design, planning principles, modeling techniques and goal-oriented analysis, communication languages \u200b\u200band agent-oriented software engineering methodologies. We will also present single and multi-agent planning techniques. \n\nExpected learning results\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to: \n1.\tDefine the most appropriate agent-oriented development process and model for the analysis, design and implementation of a multi-agent system;\n2.\tadopt the TROPOS methodology at different stages of the development of a multi-agent system;\n3.\tadopt the most appropriate architecture for the development of a software agent (reactive, deliberative, hybrid, multi-level, BDI);\n4.\tDevelop a goal-oriented model as a deliberative model of a BDI agent and define its control loop;\n5.\tUse the PDDL language to specify a planning problem and find its solutions using the backbox planner;\n6.\tDefine the communication between two or more software agents using the basic constructs of the speech-act theory;\n7.\tDevelop multi-agent systems \n",

How cells respond to the environment cues, nutrients, growth factors, and soluble circulating factors? The aim of the course is to describe the most relevant signaling pathways that control cell-cell communication and drive cell to growth, differentiate their specification and death. These networks of signals are responsible for normal physiological organogenesis and animal growth, however when uncontrolled they may result in tumor growth. This course will cover the basic concepts of signal transduction, describe the most relevant signaling pathways and their function to control physiological conditions important for development and animal growth and in pathological situations. Goals: The primary goals of this course are: 1) for students to understand what signal transduction means and what are the basis of its biological principles; 2) to appreciate and understand how to decode the huge diversity of the existing signaling mechanisms (ligand-receptor phosphorylation, cell-adhesion, post-translational modifications, second messengers signals, adaptors molecules, etc) (this part -is sustained also by 20 hrs of laboratory); 3) to learn how study signal transduction and to compare signaling in human health and in diseases; 4) to be able to understand, read and be critical on signal transduction literature. Formative aims and learning outcome: Understanding the molecular mechanism that control cell communication is at the basis not only to animal physiology but also to medical situations. Students will be exposed and stimulated to discuss topics from molecular signaling, signal transduction and molecular medicine, proteomics, structural analysis and genomic approaches. The learning outcome will bee: 1) to understand the concepts of cell-cell communication; 2) to analyze and discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in signal transduction understand the complexity of the interactions between signaling pathways within cells and how to analyze and apply their to apply their knowledge to their own research; 3) understand signaling in normal and pathological conditions and their applications to novel models that studies organ growth and tumorigenesis, i.e. tissues regeneration and the use of organoids to study signaling pathways.</p>",

This is the fundamental topic in Ecohydraulics, the discipline that focuses on the consequences of fluid and sediment processes on the organisms that inhabit aquatic environments. While still a young science, Ecohydraulics already endows the engineer with an overall understanding and quantitative tools to predict how physical processes shape habitat quality and quantity, and how, in turn, they are affected by ecological dynamics. This enables the integrated analysis of different management options for natural and man-made water bodies in terms of their ecosystem consequences. At the broadest scale, this class will contribute to the students' appreciation of the tight link between the natural and the built or impacted environment, and of the importance of considering both (and \u201chow-to\u201d) for harmonizing environmental quality with human river uses in river management and restoration.</p><p>At the end of the course the student will be able to: i) identify the different fluvial forms and their evolutionary trajectories; ii) use the hydro-morphological quality indexes and assess the status of alteration of river ecosystems; iii) understand the relations between hydro-morphology and biotic component, the causes of alteration of river ecosystems and tools to design ecological flow regimes in altered rivers; iv) appreciate the relevance of the integration of complementary disciplines for the sustainable management of water bodies.</p>",

While the first two factors are external to contract law, the third one reflects dynamics taking place within the legal domain. All the three factors affect both domestic and international transactions. The course will discuss the rules applying to business and consumer contracts in each stage of the contractual lifecycle: drafting and negotiation, formation, performance, non-performance, and conflict management. Examples from EU law, national contract law, the UN Convention on the International Sale of Mobile Goods and the Unidroit Principles on International Commercial Contracts will be provided. \nBy the end of the course, students will be able to: \n-\tUnderstand the organizing principles for business and consumer contracts\n-\tUnderstand the differences between business and consumer contracts\n-\tRead and interpret the main contract terms for business and consumer contracts\n-\tDeal with the international dimension of business and consumer contracts\n-\tApply their knowledge to new cases involving disputes on business and consumer contracts.",

Nel dibattito pubblico di ieri e oggi, tuttavia, la complessit\u00e0 dell'esperienza antica risulta spesso appiattita sul presente e piegata alle sue esigenze, offrendo il fianco a derive nazionaliste, a costruzioni identitarie o pseudo-identitarie, a strumentalizzazioni ideologiche esito di una sostanziale disattenzione per la metodologia indispensabile a una corretta ricostruzione del passato. Proprio gli aspetti metodologici trasversali a tutte le discipline storiche (L-ANT/02 Storia Greca; L-ANT/03 Storia Romana; M-STO/01 Storia Medievale; M-STO/02 Storia Moderna; M-STO/04 Storia Contemporanea) costituiranno il focus precipuo del corso: dopo alcune lezioni di carattere introduttivo dedicate allo spazio riservato all'insegnamento della storia nella scuola italiana, all'analisi delle principali metodologie didattiche e alla presentazione delle risorse utili all'insegnamento della disciplina, il corso si concentrer\u00e0 sul dema dell'uso pubblico della storia (Public History), affrontando in particolare alcuni casi di studio paradigmatici.\nL'obiettivo formativo del corso, caratterizzato da una spiccata vocazione multidisciplinare e rivolto in primis a formatrici e formatori della scuola secondaria, \u00e8 quello di dotare i futuri e le future docenti di storia, chiamati/e a svolgere un ruolo civile e sociale di importanza cruciale, di strumenti teorici e metodologici idonei a rispondere alle sfide educative del mondo contemporaneo, nonch\u00e8 di spunti tematici utli nella progettazione didattica, implementando la coscienza del loro ruolo professionale.\nAl termine del corso ci si attende che studenti e studentesse:\n1. abbiano familiarit\u00e0 con le principali metodologie e risorse utili nella didattica della storia e le sappiano utilizzare in modo critico;\n2. sappiano orientarsi nel dibattito teorico sulla Pubblic History e impiegare alcune sue applicazioni a scopi didattici;\n3. siano in grado di articolare proposte didattiche inclusive, innovative, scientificamente rigorose, capaci di stimolare la riflessione critica e le competenze di cittadinanza di studenti e studentesse;\n4. dimostrino un'adeguata consapevolezza metodologica e un'affinata competenza professionale.",

On the one hand, these emissions testify the relevance of all fundamental interactions; on the other hand, they allow to investigate more deeply and more completely phenomena and regimes otherwise inaccessible. These kinds of phenomena are often related with compact objects (i.e. black holes and neutron stars), whose description requires relativity.

They don't design protocols, nor crypto algorithms, they decide which security technology they are going to use. The course provides the fundamentals to chose the appropriate security technology based on balancing threat and controls, costs, impact and likelihood of events. In other words the course will teach students to manage risk.\n\nThe course will introduce students to the key principles of Security Risk Assessment (Risk and Threat Analysis, Risk Assessment, Control Frameworks) both qualitatively and quantitatively. The student will identify threats and the corresponding security controls appropriate for two industrial case studies.\n\n<B>Intended Learning Outcomes</B>\n\nRegular and active participation in the teaching activities offered by the course (lectures, laboratories and group work) and in independent study and project activities will enable students to:\n<UL>\n<li> understand the fundamentals of risk management;\n<li>identify the relevant assets and the corresponding impacts of possible threats for a moderately complex case study;\n<li>mitigate threats with control according to the risk appetite of a relevant stakeholder;\n<LI>quantitatively estimate, for the particular case of cyber threats, the technical impact of vulnerabilities and the particular impact on their presence in a company's enviroment;\n<LI>quantitatively estimate the overall risk for a large scale network.\n</UL>\nIn terms of soft skills, active participation in the group-based teaching activities will enable students to learn how to organize group work, apply problem-solving techniques, deliver a presentation, and support their results with compelling arguments.\n\nAt the end students who successfully passed the course should be able to prepare and defend a cyber risk assessment, identifying the threats and the security controls and the residual risk for an industrial case study of moderate complexity.",

The importance of these two issues is widely covered by the EU 2000/60 framework directives or \"Water directive\" and EU 2006/60, \"full directive\". Based on the hydrological knowledge acquired in the course of Hydrology at the Bachelor of Engineering for the Environment and the Territory, the hydrological processes, analyzed as punctual phenomena are extended to the water catchment areas. Precipitation is analyzed as a measured statistical data, both from ground stations and from remote sensing; the other processes are suitably modeled, as briefly described below. At the end of the course, a student must be able to independently model the flow rates, evaporation and transpiration in a river basin of various sizes, after having delineated it starting from digital terrain data. Of course, the student will have to demonstrate that he has critically understood the concepts that underlie the hydrological modeling presented. The knowledge acquired may be that used in the River Engineering course for the design of defense works. Hydrological modeling also introduces concepts that are used in the course of Aqueducts and Sewers for the calculation of stormwater networks. The course is partly useful for the Hydraulic Protection of the Territory course. More information is available on: \nhttps://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2020/01/hydrological-modelling-2020.html\n",

Kennedy\n\nNegotiations are an essential and fundamental moment in the life of individuals, organizations, institutions, and firms. In the last few decades, negotiation has moved from the industrial relations and political arena to the forefront of managerial interest. Negotiation, bargaining, and mediation traditionally refer to the arbitration of disputes between labour and management. However, scholars and practitioners now recognise that these skills operate in virtually every management function, including strategy formulation, mergers and acquisitions, purchasing, sales, international development and many others.\n\nNegotiation is a common mechanism for resolving differences between and allocating resources among exchange partners such as supervisors, colleagues, corporate entities and even nations. Improving negotiation skills, as well as increasing the ability to negotiate effectively, is crucial in managerial, political, and business contexts.\nThis module explores the key aspects of negotiation. The primary aim of this module is to integrate negotiation theory and practice, through an integration of concepts, models, expertise and practical experience. It will typically examine, through a mix of theory and practice, the links among negotiation fundamentals, negotiation sub-processes and negotiation contexts.\n\nLearning objectives\n\nThe purpose of this course is threefold. \n\u2022\tThe first is to explore the major concepts and theories of negotiation, as well as the dynamics of interpersonal and intergroup conflict and its resolution. This will entail material about the structural (e.g. parties, issues, positions and interest) and process-oriented (cognitive, interactional) dynamics that are necessary for a sound critical background. \n\u2022\tThe second objective is to develop skills relevant to a broad range of applied contexts. This involves direct training in identifying crucial elements of a negotiation situation and implementing appropriate resolution strategies. \n\u2022\tThe third objective is to encourage participants to assume a \u201creflective\u201d and \u201ccooperative\u201d posture about negotiations specifically and social influence broadly. \n\nOn completion of the module you should be able to:\n\n\u2022\tAnalyse a negotiation situation and its possible solutions.\n\u2022\tIdentify the personal challenges we all have in dealing with negotiation.\n\u2022\tApply complex theory and practice of negotiation in particular and general contexts.\n",

More specifically, the course will address who the social entrepreneurship actors involved in the system are, what their role is, and what are the main management practices. The course will enable participants to identify how welfare systems have changed, not only due to actions on the part of the State and the public administration, but also due to a bottom-up phenomenon of creation of private enterprises with social aims that are increasingly gaining strength both at the national and international levels.\n The course is structured in themes. The first is introductory, and aims to provide basic notions of institutional economics, i.e. the branch of economics that seeks to explain the origin and functioning of coordination mechanisms and enterprise types. The second theme will then address the concepts of welfare system and the evolution of welfare systems, in order to understand the role played by different institutions. The third theme will focus on the study of social entrepreneurship, how social enterprises can be defined according to facts and to the law, how social entrepreneurship was born and how it evolved, which are the management mechanisms of a good social enterprise, and what the future might hold.\n\n\nAt the end of the course, students will know basic economic notions and will be able to critically discuss:\n\n- institutionalist theories on the various ways of coordinating economic activities;\n\n- the distinctive features of the social service sectors and the conditions for their production;\n\n- the various modes of production and financing of social services;\n\n- the organizational and legal forms that can be used in the field of social services and work integration;\n\n- the emergence, evolution and current situation of social service organizations in Italy following the reform of the third sector.\n\nIn addition, through group work that forms part of the assessment, students are expected to develop: \n\n- an ability to find both primary and secondary data - communicative and presentation abilities",

What does it take to make this a product? Everybody can sell a beautiful concept if you don't have to build it. Also anybody can build a amazing device if you don't have to sell it. This challenging course combines the two requirements. Students have to talk to customers to understand what features are relally needed and for what costs. Students have also to make sure they can actually deliver the technological solution (that the customers wanted).\n\nFor example, you can design a scarecrow drone that flies over the crops with a predefined set-up. Unless you talk to farmers you'll never realize that random walk is necessary to actually scare the crows. Further, automatic charging as well as automated landing by computer vision and machine learning are mission critical, so that the farmer doesn't need to be there. All this with cheap mechanical, electronic, and computing solutions as the budget is extremely tight. You might have invented the idea of an iPod-style to provide news to the blind and your first technical solutions might have been to use Braille. Unless you talked (as the Joni group did) to the blind association, you are not going to discover that the majority of your customers in Italy have become blind later in life and a product that requires learning Braille at 50s-and-more is not going to be a great success. It is great for campers, to have an anti-theft device in your tent. Yet, what if it starts blasting if you just put a rucksack in the wrong position in your own tent?\n\nAll these products, and many more, were built by students participating to this course.\n\n<B>Overarching Learning Objectives</B>\n- Creativity: How to solve problems when not all steps are completely specified (this what you should try to do with your design/architectural result)\n- Intellectual Transformation: How to transform an idea into a product (the first \u201cbrainstorming\u201d step is your research canvas, the last one is the final product) by using conceptual tools from economics, mechatronic engineering, and computer science.\n- Leadership: Organize yourselves into a team and arrive to make a final product (you should try to leverage on each other\u2019s competences)\n- Making value judgement: Decide which parts are important and which are not also on the basis of ethical and social considerations.\n\n<B>Intended Learning Outcomes</B>\nRegular and active participation in the teaching activities offered by the course (lectures, supervised and indipendent group work in multi-disciplinary teams) will enable students to:\n- Learn key steps of Product Design and Development (PD&D)\n- Create a product concept which will be presented as concept's idea canvas to illustrate the key strong points on their product and their interaction with stakeholders\n- Design a detailed architecture product architecture and present it in a poster explaining how their product will work and which would be their strong point\n- Produce a final product as each team will have a small budget for hardware/software and will have to actually demonstrate a working product\n- Market their concept idea as the teams will interact with stakeholders to make sure that the product that they intend to build has actually a market.\n\nThis course should allow students to experience the creativity, intellectual transformation, leadership and value judgements skills which take to transform an idea into a working and sellable product.",

As for any other engineering discipline, the software production requires a systematic organization of the activities, the adoption of a well-defined process and methods and tools to support the quality and the respect of the project constraints. The objective of the course is providing to the students concepts, approaches and techniques for the analysis, the design, and the development of the software. In particular, the course will focus on process models, modelling languages and verification and validation techniques. Moreover, diagrammatic languages, requirements analysis methods, design principles and testing techniques will allow the students to design high quality software. The students will be practicing by developing and implementing a web service applying the most modern development techniques, including the adoption of RESTful directives and the use of standard languages for the documentation of web APIs, the collaboration in the development of the source code in a central repository, the automation of code testing, and the configuration of services and tools to set-up a continuous integration process for the software. Finally, project management concepts and metrics for software products will be introduced.\n\nEXPECTED RESULTS\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to: \n1. define the most suitable development process and model for the analysis and the design of the software under consideration; \n2. represent with the different types of diagrams the requirements, the architecture, the intarction among the components, and the deployment of the system; \n3. define and mange in a consistent and complete way the functional and non functional requirements of a software system highlighting priorities and criticises. \n4. Define the architecture of a software system adopting architectural styles and principles of refinement, abstraction, modularity, functional independency and refactoring; \n5. Design a component of a software system identifying the control type and following the step-by-step process for the respect of the general design principles; \n6. Define and document a web service compliant with RESTful directives, collaborate into the development of the source code, testing the code, and automating the deployment of the software with a continuous integration process.\n",

        "description": "<B>Course Objectives</B>\nThis course illustrates the key steps of product design and developement and guide students, forming multi-disciplinary teams, into the development of a \u201cproduct\u201d as opposed to just a \u201cproject\u201d.\n\nWe often see nice proof-of-concept research demonstration of useful tools in magazines or on web-sites. What does it take to make this a product? Everybody can sell a beautiful concept if you don't have to build it. Also anybody can build a amazing device if you don't have to sell it. This challenging course combines the two requirements. Students have to talk to customers to understand what features are relally needed and for what costs. Students have also to make sure they can actually deliver the technological solution (that the customers wanted).\n\nFor example, you can design a scarecrow drone that flies over the crops with a predefined set-up. Unless you talk to farmers you'll never realize that random walk is necessary to actually scare the crows. Further, automatic charging as well as automated landing by computer vision and machine learning are mission critical, so that the farmer doesn't need to be there. All this with cheap mechanical, electronic, and computing solutions as the budget is extremely tight. You might have invented the idea of an iPod-style to provide news to the blind and your first technical solutions might have been to use Braille. Unless you talked (as the Joni group did) to the blind association, you are not going to discover that the majority of your customers in Italy have become blind later in life and a product that requires learning Braille at 50s-and-more is not going to be a great success. It is great for campers, to have an anti-theft device in your tent. Yet, what if it starts blasting if you just put a rucksack in the wrong position in your own tent?\n\nAll these products, and many more, were built by students participating to this course.\n\n<B>Overarching Learning Objectives</B>\n- Creativity: How to solve problems when not all steps are completely specified (this what you should try to do with your design/architectural result)\n- Intellectual Transformation: How to transform an idea into a product (the first \u201cbrainstorming\u201d step is your research canvas, the last one is the final product) by using conceptual tools from economics, mechatronic engineering, and computer science.\n- Leadership: Organize yourselves into a team and arrive to make a final product (you should try to leverage on each other\u2019s competences)\n- Making value judgement: Decide which parts are important and which are not also on the basis of ethical and social considerations.\n\n<B>Intended Learning Outcomes</B>\nRegular and active participation in the teaching activities offered by the course (lectures, supervised and indipendent group work in multi-disciplinary teams) will enable students to:\n- Learn key steps of Product Design and Development (PD&D)\n- Create a product concept which will be presented as concept's idea canvas to illustrate the key strong points on their product and their interaction with stakeholders\n- Design a detailed architecture product architecture and present it in a poster explaining how their product will work and which would be their strong point\n- Produce a final product as each team will have a small budget for hardware/software and will have to actually demonstrate a working product\n- Market their concept idea as the teams will interact with stakeholders to make sure that the product that they intend to build has actually a market.\n\nThis course should allow students to experience the creativity, intellectual transformation, leadership and value judgements skills which take to transform an idea into a working and sellable product.",

Nowadays, users play different roles in innovation, production and consumption than they did previously. Users develop new forms of innovative collectives that enable their engagement with products and technologies; users generate contents, products and ideas; users face creative managers, designers and producers who will develop new strategies for involving and analyzing other users.

The second part will address the cognitive basics of calculation skills, and their neural correlations, with particular emphasis on evolutionary aspects, both phylogenetic and ontogenetic. In both modules the arguments will be constructed by illustrating examples from different fields (neuropsychology, electrophysiology, psychophysics, both on humans and on non-human animals), thus providing the student with the opportunity to deepen his / her knowledge of different methods of investigation in cognitive neuroscience. Students are expected  to become familiar with the neurocognitive architectures subtending these basic skills, and to be able to critically evaluate, in light of such knowledge, the various existing and potential educational and/or rehabilitation tools for dyslexia and dyscalculia.",

Accounting harmonization is indeed - increasingly - the true common alphabet of administration, especially in a phase of strong rationalization of public spending, and - on this basis - the understanding of account rules is both one of the main common competences required for competitions to serve in all public administrations, so as a fundamental cultural skill of legal operators that operate close to the public administrations.\nThe presence of a special judge for public accounting, if on the one hand has contributed to make the study of the subject specialized, on the other hand makes the interest for the discipline culturally relevant also for its peculiarities on the technical-legal level. The jurisprudence of the Court of Auditors offers to the study of the subject not only a rich and varied series of cases, but also some refined institutions and mechanisms - both in the areas of control and in the jurisdictional competence - where the jurists can find many ideas also for the best critical understanding of the most general institutes of the legal system.\nThe aim of the course is therefore to provide a preliminary, summarized and comprehensible image of the essential contents and of the transversal vocation of public accounting. On the one hand to allow those who want to deepen study the issue to start from a solid institutional basis, and on the other side to provide those who will deal with other sectors of the legal system (both in administrative law, as well as in criminal law and in the various areas of private law) with the tools useful to dialogue about the technicalities of accounting when their profession will be in touch with the public sphere.\n",

Then it focuses on radar and lidar systems providing a detailed analysis on: i) the main principles of active systems; ii) the criteria for designing them; iii) their applications; and iv) the related most recent developments. \nThe programme of the course is organized into four main parts. The first part presents the basic concepts and physics of active systems and introduces a taxonomy with related application examples. The second part (which takes the largest portion of the course) is devoted to a detailed analysis of radar systems. It studies different radar concepts and applications, including surveillance radars, meteorological radars, ultra-wideband radars, ground penetrating radars and radar sounders, radar tracking strategies, radar architectures for air traffic control, and synthetic aperture radar for imaging. It also addresses specific issues related to the design and performance evaluation of a radar system. The third part illustrates active systems operating with light (laser) electromagnetic sources (i.e. lidar systems), with special focus on lidar developed for altimetry measurements, environmental applications, object modelling and speed control. Finally, the fourth part (which will be distributed during the course) is based on practice experiments in laboratory aimed to provide examples of real problems and related solutions of radar and lidar signal processing and applications.",

Psychological development is considered as a complex and multidimensional process that affects the entire life cycle. Each phase of the life cycle presents new challenges to which a person, based on his/her own resources, can respond positively or negatively. We will also deal with functional and dysfunctional ways of facing the new evolutionary tasks that characterize the entire span of life, also addressing psychological disorders from an evolutionary psychopathology perspective. \n\nAt the end of the course, students will be able to:\na.\tunderstand the theories and methodologies of developmental psychology;\nb.\tdevelop critical skills and communicate clearly the acquired knowledge; \nc.\telaborate independently the acquired knowledge and relate what they have learned with other disciplines and to self-study also research areas of personal interest.",

Data Mining is the science studying mathematical models, computational paradigms, algorithms and methodologies that look for patterns and regularities in large amounts of raw data. The aim is to allow us to understand natural phenomena, business operations and human behaviors, in ways that it will allow us to turn this knowledge into predictions, forecasting and performance improvements. The goal of the course is to introduce the students to the basic concepts, principles and techniques of Data Mining, to help them develop the required skills for using the state of the art data mining algorithms for solving practical problems, and to provide them with the required experience that will later allow them to operate independently, efficiently and effectively, in highly competitive markets. The course aims also to support students wishing to pursue a research carrier by teaching them the methodologies in performing independent and effective studies and research activities. The goals of the course will be achieved by teaching the students the strengths and limitations of the various data mining techniques, how they can be applied, under what conditions and what they should expect from each application. At the end of the course, the students will be finding themselves familiar with the most popular data mining concepts and will be able to identify and use the right solutions for any data analysis problem they may find themselves into. Last but not least, future data scientists will also learn how to perform the right experiments, how to interpret the results correctly and how to present them in the most effective way. ",

        "description": "Among the most relevant consequences of globalization, we may certainly include the progressive erosion of the idea that the State is the only, or at least the most important, law-maker. The supranational integration processes - within Europe, especially in the EU case - are clear evidence of the so called \"internationalization of constitutional law\". This concept highlights the influence that the EU legal order determines on domestic legal orders in terms of competences, institutional relations (parliament and government) or as regards the relationship between citizens and the State.\nAt the same time, another trend has been slowly emerging. It is represented by the fact that the EU tends to reproduce some of the features of modern constitutionalism. This is most evident in relation to the EU case (the discussion about the Constitution-Treaty for the EU or the ECJ case law concerning the supremacy and direct effect of EC law).\nEuropean public law is thus the intersection of the eu and national legal orders and in the filed of human rights of the action of the European Court of Human Rights.\nThe course, which is primarily aimed at providing a basic understanding of the normative and institutional framework of the domestic and European Union legal order respectively, will try to present them by highlighting the increasing interrelation and reciprocal influences.\n \n",

        "description": "Intellectual property (IP) and competition policy issues are increasingly relevant to undertakings, especially to those facing dynamic markets in an international environment. The course aims at providing students with solid theoretical and practical foundations in dealing with the legal facets of managing innovation. Both intellectual property law and competition policy can be said to pursue, by different means, the same primary aim of stimulating the innovation process. On the one hand, by allowing innovators to appropriate the results of their investments, incentives are created to take risks and engage in innovation activities. Competitive markets, on the other hand, allow for new products and services to emerge and be tested by consumers and/or other undertakings. However, as long as intellectual property rights (IPRs), like in particular patents and copyrights, are considered plain monopolies, there is arguably an inherent tension between the two above mentioned legal fields, in particular where such monopoly rights granted to creators and inventors stifle growth because of poorly designed \u201cincentives\u201d rules. \nIn this vein, it is especially the role of IPRs as tools to motivate firms to invest in innovation activities that has been seriously questioned in the last two decades. The case for further and general strengthening of IPRs appears weak, and it is increasingly understood that a new balance needs to be struck between rewarding risk-takers and diffusing new knowledge. This course examines the interface between intellectual property and competition law, looking in particular at how competition law is already affecting intellectual property. Moreover, the course is aimed at analyzing the peculiarities of the legal management of the intellectual assets of firms acting in different economic sectors (e.g., fashion industry, information and communication technology markets, pharmaceutical industry). \nOn completing this course, students will be able to: \na) clearly identify those contexts in which innovation management decisions are influenced by intellectual property law and competition policy considerations\nb) explain, in an interdisciplinary way, the core principles of intellectual property and competition law \nc) employ general analysis skills helping them to identify crucial issues and therefore to ask the right questions in the management and expansion of the firm's intellectual (property) assets\nd) understand and follow international trends in the area of IPRs and competition policy especially relevant to dynamic industries (e.g., so called \u201csearch bias\u201d as investigated by competition authorities on both sides of the Atlantic and its possible meaning and effects for other undertakings active in markets affected by such practices).\n",

Although private law is still fragmented both at national and supranational levels, concepts and principles show often common roots and, when not so, they show a distinctive aptness to respond to similar issues arising in the market and the society at large. \nMoving from the acknowledgment that a Uniform Private Law at EU and global levels does not exist as legal systems, the course aims at introducing the students to the comprehension of private law matters from the perspective of a transnational lawyer, who is able to address private law issues in both purely domestic (national) and cross-border situations and to acknowledge the role that both the E.U. and the international law play in providing principles and rules applicable in private law contexts. \nActive attendance and study of class materials will enable students to:\n- explain the core concepts and principles commonly used in private law with special regard to those used within western legal tradition;\n- map the legal sources and identify the applicable legal instruments (or the needed process for their identification) to a private law situation, even if it includes elements that are linked with more than one legal system;\n- having regard to core matters of private law addressed in the course, identify the EU legislation applicable to them;\n- in addressed areas of private law, outline the core contents of a judgment of the Court of Justice and discuss its possible relevance in matters of private law at national level;\n- identify the existence of rights and define their legal nature within a concrete relation or situation in the area of private law;\n- apply principles and rules of private law to concrete cases;\n- identify the existence of conflicts and the main remedies provided by private law to protect individual and collective rights.\n",

        "description": " The evolution of economic thought, similar to that of other disciplines, does not follow a linear path, characterized by the progressive solution and \"archiving\" of the problems faced. On the contrary, if we analyze the roots of the various and different approaches to economic theory between the middle of the last century and the present era (i.e. the evolution of the contemporary debate), we often come across concepts and problems that were at the attention of economics scholars hundreds of years ago. Similarly to what happens in other scientific fields - for example in the field of astronomy - the ability to observe reality and to process and interpret the data collected gradually increases; however there is a different trait - which is instead common to all the social sciences - given by the progressive change of the reality under study. In other words, we are not faced with an \"immutable\" reality, whose behavior follows laws that scientific research allows us to understand \"better\" (whatever the epistemological meaning of this expression), but an economic and social system whose characteristics change over time. But the problems reappear and concepts that were considered to have already been sufficiently elaborated recursively return to the center of the analysis. The production and distribution of income, economic development, the role of money - to mention some of the main problems - require increasingly sophisticated analyzes, which however have their roots in theoretical elaborations even very far in time. Hence the importance, even for those immersed in contemporary debates, of knowing the ways and forms in which these problems have presented themselves and have been addressed in the past, developing concepts that are still at the center of theoretical reflection.\n\nThe course therefore aims to provide students with a logical structure to frame the evolution of economic thought and the development of the most important theories, up to the threshold of contemporary debate. Its goal is to enable the student to:\n\n\na) Learn about the evolution of the economic thought, within the framework of the evolving historical facts\nb) Recognize the main schools of thought and identify their critical issues and points\nc) Recognize the specific origins and frameworks of the contemporary economic theories \nd) Assess the appropriateness of a given analytical framework with respect to the problems analyzed by the economist\n",

Nowadays this activity has become particularly important because of the process of European integration, as being the translation a crucial phase of the drafting, interpretation and application of directives and regulations; similarly, translation is important in the publication of the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union and in the creation of principles of European law. Therefore, during the course particular attention will be dedicated to the translation of European Union law, to national law implementing directives and to European private law. At the end of the workshop the students will: - understand the characteristic of the legal language of the EU; - compare the different language versions and, in case of divergences, uncover the concept (or concepts) which transfers the ratio legis of that specific European legal act; - have learned examples of legal terminology of the EU in the chosen language (legal English, German or French).</p>",

Research in planning and scheduling is active and exciting. Planning and scheduling problems have been tackled with a variety of new approaches to address efficiency, expressivity, and practical applicability. Planning and scheduling technologies are currently used with great success in several real applications ranging from production lines and elevators to unmanned aerial and sub-sea vehicles (UAVs) and space applications. The aim of this course is to provide a comprehensive theoretical view of a wide range of planning and scheduling techniques, as well as hands-on experience in constructing and modeling planning domains to solve specific planning problems, and if time allows to experiment the control of robotic agents. After the course, the student will be able to: \u2022\tEvaluate and apply a variety of planning techniques and tools for classical planning and scheduling as well as planning and scheduling under different kind uncertainty (temporal and discrete). \u2022\tExplain the practical advantages and disadvantages of different levels of expressivity in planning and scheduling models. \u2022\tModel classical planning and scheduling problems in commonly used domain definition languages (e.g. PDDL), and if time allows, we will consider probabilistic planning problems as well. \u2022\tEvaluate and apply common techniques for goal-directed planning, such as various forms of heuristics and control rules. \u2022\tExperiment with realistic robotic agents (depending on time and availability of the robotic agents in the Robotic Lab or through simulations within ROS infrastructure).</p>",

The complexity of multi-agent systems has led to the definition of different development methodologies, software architectures and programming languages \u200b\u200bin which the concept of agent assumes a key role as well as the concept of object-oriented object-oriented design. The objective of the course is to examine and explore the credentials of agent-based approaches as a software engineering paradigm, and to gain an insight into what agent-oriented software engineering will look like. We will present agent-oriented analysis, design and implementation techniques. In particular, the course will deal with the agent concept and the development of multi-agent systems, architectures and algorithms for agent software design, planning principles, modeling techniques and goal-oriented analysis, communication languages \u200b\u200band agent-oriented software engineering methodologies. We will also present single and multi-agent planning techniques. \n\nExpected learning results\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to: \n1.\tDefine the most appropriate agent-oriented development process and model for the analysis, design and implementation of a multi-agent system;\n2.\tadopt the TROPOS methodology at different stages of the development of a multi-agent system;\n3.\tadopt the most appropriate architecture for the development of a software agent (reactive, deliberative, hybrid, multi-level, BDI);\n4.\tDevelop a goal-oriented model as a deliberative model of a BDI agent and define its control loop;\n5.\tUse the PDDL language to specify a planning problem and find its solutions using the backbox planner;\n6.\tDefine the communication between two or more software agents using the basic constructs of the speech-act theory;\n7.\tDevelop multi-agent systems \n",

        "description": "Course taught in English. Students are expected to give their presentations in English.\n\nThe course aims at presenting the institutionalist approach to economic sociology, comparative political economy and labour market economy&sociology. \nThe course will be mainly built as a seminar course, with a preliminary part mainly 'front lesson' that will introduce the basis of the discipline (economic sociology and comparative political economy plus some labor sociology).\nBasic sociological tool for the course is the \"Coleman Boat\" macro-micro-macro approach proposed by James Coleman (Foundations of Social Theory, 1990: the introduction). In the second part of the course/seminar, students will have to prepare (and present) their own 'Coleman Boat' applied to their specific topic of interest. Other students will act as discussants of each presentation. \nA great deal of activation is requested to students: readings and public discussion of papers, articles and books indicated by the teacher (for those student who attend the course) at the beginnning of the course or later on according to topics and discussions.\nA preliminary, mandatory, list of readings will be distributed at the beginning of the course, but students will be pushed to propose additional/alternative lectures on the basis of their own research interests/thesis etc. Of course, readings etc will have to be - by and large - compatible with Economic Sociology.\n\nAt the end of the course, students are expected to have understood the meaning of doing \"Sociology as Social Science\" and of performing \"Theory based empirical research\". \n\nSTUDENTS WHO DO NOT ATTEND THE COURSE but nonetheless should be willing to give the exam (f.e. students in double degree or however abroad during the second year of the MA course) are requested to get in touch with the teacher, in order to define an ad hoc paper that they will have to deliver.\n\nIt is highly appreciated that students have previously attended the BA course on Economic and Labour Sociology, taught by Prof. Barbieri. Those who did not attend the BA course are requested to prepare the Gosta Esping-Andersen 1990 book \"The Three Words of Welfare Capitalism\". (This text will have to be prepared also by students who do not attend the MA course).\n",

It introduces remote sensing methodologies, technologies and techniques that are fundamental for the design of the above-mentioned systems with the last generation of optical and radar sensors. It describes the approach to the design and implementation of systems for several applications and operative scenarios, including the design criteria for the choice of the sensors, the system architecture and data analysis techniques complementary to more general artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques presented in other mandatory courses.\nThere is a large part of the course that is common to all the students and another part (section 2) for which each attendee can select one between two modules: Module a) basics concepts in remote sensing and technologies for the acquisition of optical and radar images; or Module b) advanced concepts and design criteria for Earth observation and planetary exploration satellite missions. It is suggested that students that have not attended any basic remote sensing course follow Module a) while the others select Module b).\nThe theoretical lectures are complemented by practical examples on real systems including laboratory activities.\n\n",

Unfortunately, traditional data management technologies have been proven limited in managing data with these characteristics. This led to the term Big Data, as a way to refer to this kind of data, and new technologies been developed to cope with it. This course is an introduction to Big Data Technologies. It aims at providing an understanding of the fundamental principles, frameworks and tools upon which Big Data systems are built.\nThe students will acquire an understanding of what is big data, why it is relevant, knowledge of some of the technologies/frameworks/tools available for building big data systems and how to combine them to analyse data at scale",

        "description": " The evolution of economic thought, similar to that of other disciplines, does not follow a linear path, characterized by the progressive solution and \"archiving\" of the problems faced. On the contrary, if we analyze the roots of the various and different approaches to economic theory between the middle of the last century and the present era (i.e. the evolution of the contemporary debate), we often come across concepts and problems that were at the attention of economics scholars hundreds of years ago. Similarly to what happens in other scientific fields - for example in the field of astronomy - the ability to observe reality and to process and interpret the data collected gradually increases; however there is a different trait - which is instead common to all the social sciences - given by the progressive change of the reality under study. In other words, we are not faced with an \"immutable\" reality, whose behavior follows laws that scientific research allows us to understand \"better\" (whatever the epistemological meaning of this expression), but an economic and social system whose characteristics change over time. But the problems reappear and concepts that were considered to have already been sufficiently elaborated recursively return to the center of the analysis. The production and distribution of income, economic development, the role of money - to mention some of the main problems - require increasingly sophisticated analyzes, which however have their roots in theoretical elaborations even very far in time. Hence the importance, even for those immersed in contemporary debates, of knowing the ways and forms in which these problems have presented themselves and have been addressed in the past, developing concepts that are still at the center of theoretical reflection.\n\nThe course therefore aims to provide students with a logical structure to frame the evolution of economic thought and the development of the most important theories, up to the threshold of contemporary debate. Its goal is to enable the student to:\n\n\na) Learn about the evolution of the economic thought, within the framework of the evolving historical facts\nb) Recognize the main schools of thought and identify their critical issues and points\nc) Recognize the specific origins and frameworks of the contemporary economic theories \nd) Assess the appropriateness of a given analytical framework with respect to the problems analyzed by the economist\n",

To this is added the supplementary study of classical texts, not necessarily linked to the subject of the monographic course, functional to the theoretical training of the student. This will allow to master concepts, doctrines, paradigms, styles of reflection and argumentation that have characterized the development of the western thought in a theoretical perspective. The attention to the conceptual dimension, the semantic distribution of key terms, the logical-formal structure of arguments and the mutual questioning of theory and experience will improve the ability to decipher life contexts, thus detecting aspects not immediately evident and inedited connections between different knowledge.\nAt the end of the course the student will be able to:\nA) Identify, reconstruct and explain the philosophical subject examined during the course, knowing how to contextualize it both historically and systematically;\nB) to identify, reconstruct and present in a convincing manner the argumentative strategies exerted in the philosophical contexts examined during the course;\nC) to independently organize the acquired knowledge and the results of the analysis carried out, with appropriate references to the literature;\nD) to re-elaborate the acquired knowledge through the production of a written philosophical review, referring to one of the texts specifically indicated in the program and related to the monographic subject of the course.

It aims at providing students with the knowledge and competences necessary to acquire a thorough understanding of international organizations, with particular reference to the European Union. The class is organized with the Jean Monnet Chair \"The Western Balkans: Enlargement and Resilience,\" (EUWeBER) which is managed by the instructor (prof. Roberto Belloni) together with the Osservatorio Balcani and Caucaso (a think-tank based in Trento). Thus, while while being coherently structured as a free-standing class, this course is also conceived as preparatory to \"The European Union and its Neighbors,\" which is offered by the Department at the third years. \nDuring the semester, the class will introduce the main international relations theories and apply them to three main groups of organizations: those dealing with peace and security (ONU, NATO, EU), economics and finance (World Bank, IMF, WTO) and humanitarian and social issues (UNHCR, International Criminal Tribunal, UN Environmental Programme). Particular attention will be given to the foreign policy of the European Union. \nAt the end of the class, the students will be able to define and understand the main international relations theories and to apply them to different international organizations, evalutating their functions and impact.

Cloud technologies and methodologies, such as virtualisation, containerisation, micro-service based architectures and service-meshes, are becoming prevalent among large technology providers, cloud operators and software developers. New software applications are, in turn, being developed following the so called cloud-native paradigm in order to exploit the benefits, such as scalability and reliability, offered by the cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nWithin this technological revolution, topics such as data locality and management are also attracting increasing interest. For this reason, one area of significant development in this space is that of edge computing resources, leading to the emergence of the fog computing paradigm. Indeed, more and more services are beginning to exploit, or even require, its benefits in terms of reduced latency, lower bandwidth consumption through near data source pre-processing, or simply guarantees around the geo-location of data.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to Cloud and Fog computing principles and technologies, following a practical, hands-on approach. More specifically, at the end of the course the student will: (1) learn about cloud and fog computing models, technologies and existing solutions; (2) acquire relevant knowledge on advanced topics related to networking, orchestration and security; (3) use and configure advanced open-source platforms to create and manage cloud computing infrastructures and to effectively and dynamically orchestrate workloads.",

Automated planning and scheduling is a central topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI), and task and motion planning capabilities are essential to the construction of many robust autonomous systems. Research in planning and scheduling is active and exciting. Planning and scheduling problems have been tackled with a variety of new approaches to address efficiency, expressivity, and practical applicability. Planning and scheduling technologies are currently used with great success in several real applications ranging from production lines and elevators to unmanned aerial and sub-sea vehicles (UAVs) and space applications. The aim of this course is to provide a comprehensive theoretical view of a wide range of planning and scheduling techniques, as well as hands-on experience in constructing and modeling planning domains to solve specific planning problems, and if time allows to experiment the control of robotic agents. After the course, the student will be able to: \u2022\tEvaluate and apply a variety of planning techniques and tools for classical planning and scheduling as well as planning and scheduling under different kind uncertainty (temporal and discrete). \u2022\tExplain the practical advantages and disadvantages of different levels of expressivity in planning and scheduling models. \u2022\tModel classical planning and scheduling problems in commonly used domain definition languages (e.g. PDDL), and if time allows, we will consider probabilistic planning problems as well. \u2022\tEvaluate and apply common techniques for goal-directed planning, such as various forms of heuristics and control rules. \u2022\tExperiment with realistic robotic agents (depending on time and availability of the robotic agents in the Robotic Lab or through simulations within ROS infrastructure).</p>",

Cloud technologies and methodologies, such as virtualisation, containerisation, micro-service based architectures and service-meshes, are becoming prevalent among large technology providers, cloud operators and software developers. New software applications are, in turn, being developed following the so called cloud-native paradigm in order to exploit the benefits, such as scalability and reliability, offered by the cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nWithin this technological revolution, topics such as data locality and management are also attracting increasing interest. For this reason, one area of significant development in this space is that of edge computing resources, leading to the emergence of the fog computing paradigm. Indeed, more and more services are beginning to exploit, or even require, its benefits in terms of reduced latency, lower bandwidth consumption through near data source pre-processing, or simply guarantees around the geo-location of data.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to Cloud and Fog computing principles and technologies, following a practical, hands-on approach. More specifically, at the end of the course the student will: (1) learn about cloud and fog computing models, technologies and existing solutions; (2) acquire relevant knowledge on advanced topics related to networking, orchestration and security; (3) use and configure advanced open-source platforms to create and manage cloud computing infrastructures and to effectively and dynamically orchestrate workloads.",

The general purpose of this course is to familiarise you with problems associated with unaided managerial decision making, as well as with structured decision aiding techniques aiming to overcome these problems. Students will also obtain an understanding of the thinking processes that underlie judgement and decision making, and its systematic errors and biases.\n\nThe course will be organised in two parts. (1) The first, smaller, part will focus on the psychology of judgement and decision-making. You will be familiarized with psychological research demonstrating that humans have bounded rationality and are susceptible to systematic errors and biases. We will briefly cover the heuristics and biases approach and prospect theory. (2) The second, more substantial, part concerns decision aiding tools. You will be presented with structured decision aiding techniques that aim to improve the quality of managerial decisions in the realm of business as well as public policy. Their core concept is simplification, breaking a complex problem into a number of simpler problems. For each technique, you will be presented with the steps that it involves and how to apply it to real-life problems. We will discuss SMART, planning networks, decision trees, simulation, and financial analysis. We will also discuss how to be more effective in bargaining and negotiation, which is another central activity in management.\n\nBy the end of the course students should have acquired:\n-an in-depth understanding of why unaided decision making is often biased. This involves attaining a good grasp of the psychology of judgement and decision making. Students should also be able to cite and critically evaluate empirical evidence.\n-an understanding of the various decision-aiding techniques including: the contexts in which each technique should be applied, the steps that they involve, and the benefits/shortcomings of each. Importantly, the students should have also acquired the ability to apply such techniques to solve novel problems.\n-an understanding of Raiffa's decision-analytic approach to negotiation, and the ability to apply it to negotiation problems.\n-the ability to read journal articles, understand and discuss the main theoretical points and evidence, and critically evaluate them.",

The architectural restoration, which by its statute deals with the fate of cultural heritage, has always deeply contributed to this debate by proposing, over time, different ways to address it. The course covers the understanding of the objectives, the methods and techniques of a complex and operationally design discipline, closely intertwined with other fields such as architectural composition, history, the sciences and structural techniques. It follows a project method based on the knowledge of monuments, achieved through numerous analytical research that aims to understand the value of the monument and this preserve it.</p><p>The learning outcomes (knowledge and skills) are:</p><p>1. KNOWLEDGE AND COMPREHENSION.</p><p>The student will acquire through the theoretical lessons and classroom activities knowledge and comprehension of the theoretical and practical issues of restoration discipline with particular reference to the following aspects:</p><p>1.1 the student is encouraged to became critically aware of the actions he/she takes in the conservation of a historic structure, and the affects this actions can have on the outcome learning the importance of the \u201ccare\u201d that needs to be taken in such work. This awareness then acts as a guide when facing the potential problems that can arise in the moment in which the structural stability and/or use of a given historic construction is either improved or modified.</p><p>1.2 Make the student able to elaborate a restoration project with the procedures necessary for the public institutions of the protection of monuments.</p><p>To achieve these learning outcomes the course will provide students with:</p><p>1.1. basic knowledge of principles of architectural restoration (preservation)</p><p>1.2. theoretical and practical for the elaboration of project on a multilayered context.</p><p>2 ABILITY TO APPLY KNOWLEDGE AND COMPREHENSION</p><p>The student will acquire through classroom and laboratory exercises, practical skills for the project of architectural restoration with particular reference to the following fields of activity:</p><p>2.1 diagnostic project to recognize the problems of material conservation and the value of testimony of a multi-layered historical context;</p><p>2.2 reuse proposals compatible with pre-existence.</p><p>3. AUTONOMY OF JUDGMENT, SKILLS AND LEARNING ABILITIES</p><p>The student will acquire, through group exercises and team work, the ability to:</p><p>3.1. act, communicate and evaluate, critically and autonomy of judgement, the principles and techniques necessary to carry out a restoration project compatible with the value of a historical context.</p><p><br></p><p>The expected learning result is the ability to set up and develop a restoration project based on knowledge of the techniques of analysis and interpretation of a stratified architectural and urban context; the ability to design a project proposal focusing on the recognition of the existing as a witness value, on architectural design tools intended as a poetic transformation, between memory and invention; the ability to apply methodologies and intervention techniques as a response to conservation and innovation issues; the ability to communicate, through narration, graphic board, 3D models, the spatial, formal and technical of the architectural project.</p>",

Kennedy\n\nNegotiations are an essential and fundamental moment in the life of individuals, organizations, institutions, and firms. In the last few decades, negotiation has moved from the industrial relations and political arena to the forefront of managerial interest. Negotiation, bargaining, and mediation traditionally refer to the arbitration of disputes between labour and management. However, scholars and practitioners now recognise that these skills operate in virtually every management function, including strategy formulation, mergers and acquisitions, purchasing, sales, international development and many others.\n\nNegotiation is a common mechanism for resolving differences between and allocating resources among exchange partners such as supervisors, colleagues, corporate entities and even nations. Improving negotiation skills, as well as increasing the ability to negotiate effectively, is crucial in managerial, political, and business contexts.\nThis module explores the key aspects of negotiation. The primary aim of this module is to integrate negotiation theory and practice, through an integration of concepts, models, expertise and practical experience. It will typically examine, through a mix of theory and practice, the links among negotiation fundamentals, negotiation sub-processes and negotiation contexts.\n\nLearning objectives\n\nThe purpose of this course is threefold. \n\u2022\tThe first is to explore the major concepts and theories of negotiation, as well as the dynamics of interpersonal and intergroup conflict and its resolution. This will entail material about the structural (e.g. parties, issues, positions and interest) and process-oriented (cognitive, interactional) dynamics that are necessary for a sound critical background. \n\u2022\tThe second objective is to develop skills relevant to a broad range of applied contexts. This involves direct training in identifying crucial elements of a negotiation situation and implementing appropriate resolution strategies. \n\u2022\tThe third objective is to encourage participants to assume a \u201creflective\u201d and \u201ccooperative\u201d posture about negotiations specifically and social influence broadly. \n\nOn completion of the module you should be able to:\n\n\u2022\tAnalyse a negotiation situation and its possible solutions.\n\u2022\tIdentify the personal challenges we all have in dealing with negotiation.\n\u2022\tApply complex theory and practice of negotiation in particular and general contexts.\n",

Cloud technologies and methodologies, such as virtualisation, containerisation, micro-service based architectures and service-meshes, are becoming prevalent among large technology providers, cloud operators and software developers. New software applications are, in turn, being developed following the so called cloud-native paradigm in order to exploit the benefits, such as scalability and reliability, offered by the cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nWithin this technological revolution, topics such as data locality and management are also attracting increasing interest. For this reason, one area of significant development in this space is that of edge computing resources, leading to the emergence of the fog computing paradigm. Indeed, more and more services are beginning to exploit, or even require, its benefits in terms of reduced latency, lower bandwidth consumption through near data source pre-processing, or simply guarantees around the geo-location of data.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to Cloud and Fog computing principles and technologies, following a practical, hands-on approach. More specifically, at the end of the course the student will: (1) learn about cloud and fog computing models, technologies and existing solutions; (2) acquire relevant knowledge on advanced topics related to networking, orchestration and security; (3) use and configure advanced open-source platforms to create and manage cloud computing infrastructures and to effectively and dynamically orchestrate workloads.",

The course aims also to support students wishing to pursue a research carrier by teaching them the methodologies in performing independent and effective studies and research activities. The goals of the course will be achieved by teaching the students the strengths and limitations of the various data mining techniques, how they can be applied, under what conditions and what they should expect from each application. At the end of the course, the students will be finding themselves familiar with the most popular data mining concepts and will be able to identify and use the right solutions for any data analysis problem they may find themselves into. Last but not least, future data scientists will also learn how to perform the right experiments, how to interpret the results correctly and how to present them in the most effective way. ",

        "description": "The landscape of robotics has gone through a deep change throughout the last decade. Up until the early years of this century, robots were seen as heavy and dangerous machines used to execute stiffly defined tasks within controlled and structured environments. The recent advances in artificial intelligence have had a profound impact on the type of tasks that a robot can perform and on the level of safety and reliability they can be executed with. Modern robots assist older adults or  impaired people, work side by side with human workers, drive on the highways with little or no assistance. This paradigm shift requires the robot to perceive and understand the situation in the surroundings, to autonomously plan a suitable course of actions for a task, and to see to its correct execution by properly reacting to unexpected events. \nTo design a machine of this complexity, engineers need several competencies tapping diverse disciplines. Robots are physical machines created by humans, so their motion can be analysed and controlled through appropriate mathematical models. Robots move in a partially known environment, so they need to create a map of their surroundings, to localise themselves within the environment, to detect, classify and recognise the different objects they interact with. Robots are required to be autonomous or sem-iautonomous, so they need the ability to decide a sequence of actions (a plan), to implement it within appropriate safety bounds and to adapt it to changes as needed. Finally, robots embed computing machines that need to be programmed through appropriate languages and frameworks. \nThe students will be introduced to each one of these different aspects and will receive the opportunity to put them into practice using our advanced educational laboratories and teaching facilities. After taking the course, they will be able to take on a career as developers of robotic applications and/or to continue with advanced studies in the area of intelligent robots.",

What does it take to make this a product? Everybody can sell a beautiful concept if you don't have to build it. Also anybody can build a amazing device if you don't have to sell it. This challenging course combines the two requirements. Students have to talk to customers to understand what features are relally needed and for what costs. Students have also to make sure they can actually deliver the technological solution (that the customers wanted).\n\nFor example, you can design a scarecrow drone that flies over the crops with a predefined set-up. Unless you talk to farmers you'll never realize that random walk is necessary to actually scare the crows. Further, automatic charging as well as automated landing by computer vision and machine learning are mission critical, so that the farmer doesn't need to be there. All this with cheap mechanical, electronic, and computing solutions as the budget is extremely tight. You might have invented the idea of an iPod-style to provide news to the blind and your first technical solutions might have been to use Braille. Unless you talked (as the Joni group did) to the blind association, you are not going to discover that the majority of your customers in Italy have become blind later in life and a product that requires learning Braille at 50s-and-more is not going to be a great success. It is great for campers, to have an anti-theft device in your tent. Yet, what if it starts blasting if you just put a rucksack in the wrong position in your own tent?\n\nAll these products, and many more, were built by students participating to this course.\n\n<B>Overarching Learning Objectives</B>\n- Creativity: How to solve problems when not all steps are completely specified (this what you should try to do with your design/architectural result)\n- Intellectual Transformation: How to transform an idea into a product (the first \u201cbrainstorming\u201d step is your research canvas, the last one is the final product) by using conceptual tools from economics, mechatronic engineering, and computer science.\n- Leadership: Organize yourselves into a team and arrive to make a final product (you should try to leverage on each other\u2019s competences)\n- Making value judgement: Decide which parts are important and which are not also on the basis of ethical and social considerations.\n\n<B>Intended Learning Outcomes</B>\nRegular and active participation in the teaching activities offered by the course (lectures, supervised and indipendent group work in multi-disciplinary teams) will enable students to:\n- Learn key steps of Product Design and Development (PD&D)\n- Create a product concept which will be presented as concept's idea canvas to illustrate the key strong points on their product and their interaction with stakeholders\n- Design a detailed architecture product architecture and present it in a poster explaining how their product will work and which would be their strong point\n- Produce a final product as each team will have a small budget for hardware/software and will have to actually demonstrate a working product\n- Market their concept idea as the teams will interact with stakeholders to make sure that the product that they intend to build has actually a market.\n\nThis course should allow students to experience the creativity, intellectual transformation, leadership and value judgements skills which take to transform an idea into a working and sellable product.",

Moreover, training models based on frontal learning of notions (concept-based) and those based on the resolution of concrete problems (problem-based), although still essential, do not seem entirely suitable to provide the tools to consciously choose methods and conceptual vocabularies in a jagged horizon. Therefore, the primary objective of the course will be to know the debate and the techniques that allow to participate in it; how to build a legal argument and how to counter-argument what the other party claims. At the end of the course the student will be able to actively participate in a debate by organizing his or her own claim, while at the same time contesting the adverse claim. An increase in public speaking, the ability to organize one's own reasoning and one's ability to discuss is expected.\n",

Ample space will be given to reading texts of some of the chief characters of the Scientific Revolution, paying specific attention to the works of Kepler and Galileo \u2013 two contemporaries who gave major contributions to scientific thought, but had a very different understanding of the very science they were practicing.\nSpecial attention will be paid to the reading of the \u201cdialogue\u201d that took place between them, through their letters and works, particularly Kepler\u2019s Dissertatio (1610) and Narratio (1611). Texts will be read against the scientific, historic, intellectual and religious background of the early decades of the 17th century, and in the light of the contribution of the authors\u2019 contemporaries.\nThe second part of the course will be devoted to Galileo\u2019s Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems (1632), one of the most important scientific works of the early modern period. We will consider what came before the Dialogue, and what were the consequences of its publication: the trial, the sentence, the abjuration, and how the events affected the practice of science in Italy.\nAt the end of the course, students will have acquired a detailed knowledge (i.e. based on the actual reading of the original texts, and not merely on the historical reconstruction of their contents) of the debate on the nature, aim, and scope of early modern science.\nStudents are expected to be able:\n\u2014 to understand the ways in which the very idea of science has evolved, and what characterizes in throughout its many transformations;\n\u2014 to read and understand, in its original language or in translation, the works of some of the key protagonists of the Scientific Revolutions;\n\u2014 to consult specialized works in the history of science;\n\u2014 to deliver a presentation that develops a specific subject referred to in the course;\n\u2014 to take an oral examination on the subjects presented at the course, discussing specific passages and putting them in their proper context.",

Applied Ecology includes natural resource conservation, natural flora and fauna management, water resource management, pest management, pollution and ecotoxycology, natural landscape change, climate change and global warming. Applied ecology and biodiversity study are profoundly intertwined, both in the monitoring phases and in the management choices. The recent and far past clearly shows that technical and engineering choices cannot ignore environmental and ecological sustainability, to avoid the repetition of dramatic disasters like desertification of vast areas, river rectification, Vajont, Stava, Lambro and Danube poisoning, radioactive poisoning in north and south Germany, Tchernobyl and Fukushima, plastic and micro-plastic sea and soil pollution. All these disasters will result in huge costs in environmental, economical terms and they will often directly affect local population health condition. The major causes of the current important economic crisis are due to an environmental crisis that lead to a lack of resources exacerbated by human induced Climate change. This picture was generated by overexploitation and inefficiency in the use of natural resources, caused by the underestimation of the consequences of environmental problems to ecosystem services in an holistic vision. The course will deal with the environments in temperate and boreal climates and with the tropical and subtropical regions. The course will deal with theoretical fundamental elements and practical examples to understand Applied Ecology, giving hints about future developments of this science. Among the topics treated in the course: Ecocertification, biomonitoring, Biosensors, GIS, dynamic landscape modeling, definition of criteria for protected areas planning and management. Species distribution models and prediction of future landscape change with Markov Chains and Cellular automata will be treated. Seminars held by experts and visits to Applied Ecology offices will be organized. The students shall be able to apply Applied Ecology knowledge to understand the consequences of anthropic disturbance on environment and ecosystems. They shall be able to know monitoring field and modeling tools that can help the management of applied ecology. The students will be requested to write an original research paper treating and analyzing a specific topic in a critical perspective.</p>",

Automated planning and scheduling is a central topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI), and task and motion planning capabilities are essential to the construction of many robust autonomous systems. Research in planning and scheduling is active and exciting. Planning and scheduling problems have been tackled with a variety of new approaches to address efficiency, expressivity, and practical applicability. Planning and scheduling technologies are currently used with great success in several real applications ranging from production lines and elevators to unmanned aerial and sub-sea vehicles (UAVs) and space applications. The aim of this course is to provide a comprehensive theoretical view of a wide range of planning and scheduling techniques, as well as hands-on experience in constructing and modeling planning domains to solve specific planning problems, and if time allows to experiment the control of robotic agents. After the course, the student will be able to: \u2022\tEvaluate and apply a variety of planning techniques and tools for classical planning and scheduling as well as planning and scheduling under different kind uncertainty (temporal and discrete). \u2022\tExplain the practical advantages and disadvantages of different levels of expressivity in planning and scheduling models. \u2022\tModel classical planning and scheduling problems in commonly used domain definition languages (e.g. PDDL), and if time allows, we will consider probabilistic planning problems as well. \u2022\tEvaluate and apply common techniques for goal-directed planning, such as various forms of heuristics and control rules. \u2022\tExperiment with realistic robotic agents (depending on time and availability of the robotic agents in the Robotic Lab or through simulations within ROS infrastructure).</p>",

        "description": " The evolution of economic thought, similar to that of other disciplines, does not follow a linear path, characterized by the progressive solution and \"archiving\" of the problems faced. On the contrary, if we analyze the roots of the various and different approaches to economic theory between the middle of the last century and the present era (i.e. the evolution of the contemporary debate), we often come across concepts and problems that were at the attention of economics scholars hundreds of years ago. Similarly to what happens in other scientific fields - for example in the field of astronomy - the ability to observe reality and to process and interpret the data collected gradually increases; however there is a different trait - which is instead common to all the social sciences - given by the progressive change of the reality under study. In other words, we are not faced with an \"immutable\" reality, whose behavior follows laws that scientific research allows us to understand \"better\" (whatever the epistemological meaning of this expression), but an economic and social system whose characteristics change over time. But the problems reappear and concepts that were considered to have already been sufficiently elaborated recursively return to the center of the analysis. The production and distribution of income, economic development, the role of money - to mention some of the main problems - require increasingly sophisticated analyzes, which however have their roots in theoretical elaborations even very far in time. Hence the importance, even for those immersed in contemporary debates, of knowing the ways and forms in which these problems have presented themselves and have been addressed in the past, developing concepts that are still at the center of theoretical reflection.\n\nThe course therefore aims to provide students with a logical structure to frame the evolution of economic thought and the development of the most important theories, up to the threshold of contemporary debate. Its goal is to enable the student to:\n\n\na) Learn about the evolution of the economic thought, within the framework of the evolving historical facts\nb) Recognize the main schools of thought and identify their critical issues and points\nc) Recognize the specific origins and frameworks of the contemporary economic theories \nd) Assess the appropriateness of a given analytical framework with respect to the problems analyzed by the economist\n",

The second part introduces the payout policy, in perfect market and in the presence of frictions. The third part analyses the typical sources of capital for corporation, in term of both equity and debt (bonds, leasing), with a medium/ long-term perspective. The fourth part introduces mergers and acquisition. The fifth part concerns finance for SMEs\n\n2.

The science originated in the 1970s but reached its peak in 2002, when Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, psychologists, were awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for having integrated results of psychological research into economic science, especially with regard to human judgment and decision theory under conditions of uncertainty. A few years later, Richard Thaler, a behavioral economist and long-time collaborator of Kahneman and Tversky had the idea of using the results of their research to design interventions aimed at improving the well-being of citizens and workers. He summarized his ideas in a book published with Cass Sunstein in 2008 (Nudge). Nudging (gentle pushing) was born, an alternative practice to classic policies, for the conception of which Richard Thaler received the 2017 Nobel Prize in economics. In the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors decided to revise and rewrite the 2008 book. On August 3, 2021, \"Nudge: the final Edition\" was published.</p><p><br></p><p>Today there is a wide spread around the world of Nudge Units (Behavioral Insights Teams).In 2018 the European Union also created a Behavioral Insight Unit. These units collect experimental research findings from various disciplines from behavioral sciences such as behavioral economics to social psychology and cognitive psychology and use them to devise \"behavioral\" interventions that benefit the decision maker. Old-fashioned policies often fail to take into account people's actual behavior. For example, few of us read the entire contract before downloading a new app on our cell phones, and many of us take impulsive actions that we regret later. The behavioral sciences provide empirical evidence to anticipate how people will react to interventions, and they seek to design interventions in ways that make it easier for citizens and workers to make decisions and more closely match their goals. Such nudging interventions have been used to increase savings, reduce consumption, increase health, improve care for the environment, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, you will be able to:</p><p>- develop an understanding of the basic mechanisms of human decision-making.</p><p>- understand how to design behavioral interventions that, by considering these mechanisms, reduce decision fatigue and increase the well-being of citizens and workers.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

This is the fundamental topic in Ecohydraulics, the discipline that focuses on the consequences of fluid and sediment processes on the organisms that inhabit aquatic environments. While still a young science, Ecohydraulics already endows the engineer with an overall understanding and quantitative tools to predict how physical processes shape habitat quality and quantity, and how, in turn, they are affected by ecological dynamics. This enables the integrated analysis of different management options for natural and man-made water bodies in terms of their ecosystem consequences. At the broadest scale, this class will contribute to the students' appreciation of the tight link between the natural and the built or impacted environment, and of the importance of considering both (and \u201chow-to\u201d) for harmonizing environmental quality with human river uses in river management and restoration.</p><p>At the end of the course the student will be able to: i) identify the different fluvial forms and their evolutionary trajectories; ii) use the hydro-morphological quality indexes and assess the status of alteration of river ecosystems; iii) understand the relations between hydro-morphology and biotic component, the causes of alteration of river ecosystems and tools to design ecological flow regimes in altered rivers; iv) appreciate the relevance of the integration of complementary disciplines for the sustainable management of water bodies.</p>",

In the module \" Spatio-temporal Models in Cell and Tissue Biology\", after an introduction to partial differential equations and to some techniques for obtaining or approximating their solutions, some of the most interesting features of reaction-diffusion equations (travelling wave solutions, Turing mechanism) will be presented in a biological context (signal propagation in axons, morphogenesis).</p><h2>Learning outcome</h2><p>The final part of the course will be devoted to the development of a group project on a subject presented during the course. At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to build mathematical models for biological systems similar to those presented in the course, to perform simple qualitative analysis of systems of ordinary differential equations, to simulate systems of ordinary differential equations and of reaction-diffusion equations using Matlab.

It will analyze some paradigmatic European and Western national legal systems, as well as relevant international and soft law instruments (such as the CISG, the Principles of European contract law (PECL) and the Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR)).\nThrough the study and critical discussion of these materials, students will learn to identify and explain similarities and differences among legal systems, not only from a formal point of view, but also in the law in action. They will learn how to frame a legal research, where to look for relevant materials, how to analyze them and develop a critical synthesis, and how to elaborate the results of their analysis, both orally and in writing.\n",

The complexity of multi-agent systems has led to the definition of different development methodologies, software architectures and programming languages \u200b\u200bin which the concept of agent assumes a key role as well as the concept of object-oriented object-oriented design. The objective of the course is to examine and explore the credentials of agent-based approaches as a software engineering paradigm, and to gain an insight into what agent-oriented software engineering will look like. We will present agent-oriented analysis, design and implementation techniques. In particular, the course will deal with the agent concept and the development of multi-agent systems, architectures and algorithms for agent software design, planning principles, modeling techniques and goal-oriented analysis, communication languages \u200b\u200band agent-oriented software engineering methodologies. We will also present single and multi-agent planning techniques. \n\nExpected learning results\nAt the end of the course, the student will be able to: \n1.\tDefine the most appropriate agent-oriented development process and model for the analysis, design and implementation of a multi-agent system;\n2.\tadopt the TROPOS methodology at different stages of the development of a multi-agent system;\n3.\tadopt the most appropriate architecture for the development of a software agent (reactive, deliberative, hybrid, multi-level, BDI);\n4.\tDevelop a goal-oriented model as a deliberative model of a BDI agent and define its control loop;\n5.\tUse the PDDL language to specify a planning problem and find its solutions using the backbox planner;\n6.\tDefine the communication between two or more software agents using the basic constructs of the speech-act theory;\n7.\tDevelop multi-agent systems \n",

Cloud technologies and methodologies, such as virtualisation, containerisation, micro-service based architectures and service-meshes, are becoming prevalent among large technology providers, cloud operators and software developers. New software applications are, in turn, being developed following the so called cloud-native paradigm in order to exploit the benefits, such as scalability and reliability, offered by the cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nWithin this technological revolution, topics such as data locality and management are also attracting increasing interest. For this reason, one area of significant development in this space is that of edge computing resources, leading to the emergence of the fog computing paradigm. Indeed, more and more services are beginning to exploit, or even require, its benefits in terms of reduced latency, lower bandwidth consumption through near data source pre-processing, or simply guarantees around the geo-location of data.\n\nThis course provides an introduction to Cloud and Fog computing principles and technologies, following a practical, hands-on approach. More specifically, at the end of the course the student will: (1) learn about cloud and fog computing models, technologies and existing solutions; (2) acquire relevant knowledge on advanced topics related to networking, orchestration and security; (3) use and configure advanced open-source platforms to create and manage cloud computing infrastructures and to effectively and dynamically orchestrate workloads.",

        "description": "The landscape of robotics has gone through a deep change throughout the last decade. Up until the early years of this century, robots were seen as heavy and dangerous machines used to execute stiffly defined tasks within controlled and structured environments. The recent advances in artificial intelligence have had a profound impact on the type of tasks that a robot can perform and on the level of safety and reliability they can be executed with. Modern robots assist older adults or  impaired people, work side by side with human workers, drive on the highways with little or no assistance. This paradigm shift requires the robot to perceive and understand the situation in the surroundings, to autonomously plan a suitable course of actions for a task, and to see to its correct execution by properly reacting to unexpected events. \nTo design a machine of this complexity, engineers need several competencies tapping diverse disciplines. Robots are physical machines created by humans, so their motion can be analysed and controlled through appropriate mathematical models. Robots move in a partially known environment, so they need to create a map of their surroundings, to localise themselves within the environment, to detect, classify and recognise the different objects they interact with. Robots are required to be autonomous or sem-iautonomous, so they need the ability to decide a sequence of actions (a plan), to implement it within appropriate safety bounds and to adapt it to changes as needed. Finally, robots embed computing machines that need to be programmed through appropriate languages and frameworks. \nThe students will be introduced to each one of these different aspects and will receive the opportunity to put them into practice using our advanced educational laboratories and teaching facilities. After taking the course, they will be able to take on a career as developers of robotic applications and/or to continue with advanced studies in the area of intelligent robots.",

In particular, the program is focused on time series regression models, time series decomposition, exponential smoothing and ARIMA models. The approach is data-driven, i.e. we will introduce only the theory necessary for the analysis of real datasets. At the end of the course the student is expected to be able to (i) estimate a multiple time series regression model and interpret the results; (ii) predict a time series by means of an appropriate forecasting method and interpret the results; (iii) master the R software.\nMy main goal in teaching this class consists in transmitting to the students the belief that apparently complicated statistical techniques are not only mathematical sophistications, but also tools with a tremendous impact in practical applications, and that they are important assets for professional success. In my opinion, a manager who masters complex statistical methods has a better understanding of the processes and projects going on in an organization.\nI am convinced that the most effective way of learning quantitative methods is based on problem solving. Accordingly, I will assign regular homeworks that have a threefold advantage:\n1. they mimick a situation that the students will often encounter in their career: they will have to solve a problem within a deadline;\n2. they encourage group work: even though the students will be individually responsible for the solution, hopefully they will realize that working together can produce a better result in a shorter time;\n3. they will give the students a motivation for a thorough understanding of the methods presented in class.",

Applied Ecology includes natural resource conservation, natural flora and fauna management, water resource management, pest management, pollution and ecotoxycology, natural landscape change, climate change and global warming. Applied ecology and biodiversity study are profoundly intertwined, both in the monitoring phases and in the management choices. The recent and far past clearly shows that technical and engineering choices cannot ignore environmental and ecological sustainability, to avoid the repetition of dramatic disasters like desertification of vast areas, river rectification, Vajont, Stava, Lambro and Danube poisoning, radioactive poisoning in north and south Germany, Tchernobyl and Fukushima, plastic and micro-plastic sea and soil pollution. All these disasters will result in huge costs in environmental, economical terms and they will often directly affect local population health condition. The major causes of the current important economic crisis are due to an environmental crisis that lead to a lack of resources exacerbated by human induced Climate change. This picture was generated by overexploitation and inefficiency in the use of natural resources, caused by the underestimation of the consequences of environmental problems to ecosystem services in an holistic vision. The course will deal with the environments in temperate and boreal climates and with the tropical and subtropical regions. The course will deal with theoretical fundamental elements and practical examples to understand Applied Ecology, giving hints about future developments of this science. Among the topics treated in the course: Ecocertification, biomonitoring, Biosensors, GIS, dynamic landscape modeling, definition of criteria for protected areas planning and management. Species distribution models and prediction of future landscape change with Markov Chains and Cellular automata will be treated. Seminars held by experts and visits to Applied Ecology offices will be organized. The students shall be able to apply Applied Ecology knowledge to understand the consequences of anthropic disturbance on environment and ecosystems. They shall be able to know monitoring field and modeling tools that can help the management of applied ecology. The students will be requested to write an original research paper treating and analyzing a specific topic in a critical perspective.</p>",

Topics include molecular mechanisms of transport across biological membranes, the ionic basis of the action potential generation and propagation and the sensory systems organization. The contribution of the physical techniques to provide information about biological molecules (i.e structure, size, shape, dynamics, and modes of interaction), cells (i.e. images of cells, of the subcellular structures, monitoring of cell and intracellular movements) and more complex living systems (i.e. living organisms, human beings.) is highlighted. The pivotal role of biophysics to the progress of human physiology, molecular medicine and diagnostics is also underlined. \n\nAt the conclusion of this course, students will:\na)\tHave fundamental knowledge of the properties of biological macromolecules in term of the physical principles which relate their structure and of the mechanisms of their biological function;\nb)\tHave basic knowledge of some physiological process (such as nerve impulse or visual perception) where physical mechanisms and biological architectures meet to make life able to perform its peculiar mechanisms. \nc)\tBe able to deal with the continuous progress of biophysical research and learning from scientific literature.\nThis course is introductory to medical physics, to study of the interaction of radiation with living matter and to the advanced course Molecular and Cellular Biophysics.\n",

        "description": "Students completing this course will gain knowledge of the principal definitions, theoretical reflections and debates on civil society, global civil society, and contentious politics. They will study how thinkers have linked ideas of civil society to war or conflict and the consequences of this. They will also study critiques of so-called classical, or Enlightenment-based, ideas of civil society by post-modern and post-colonial thinkers who have pointed out the detrimental effects these ideas have had. In their study of contentious politics (confrontations of different types between collective actors and authorities or power holders), students will reflect on the ways that these are embedded in broader social and political processes. They will gain knowledge of key concepts such as cycles of contention, radicalization, institutionalization and NGOization, which are useful for the empirical analysis of contentious episodes. Students will learn how text analysis can aid scholars to understand the discursive power, action choices and outcomes of contentious politics, and be able to design and conduct basic text analysis using appropriate software. They will also be able to apply the theories and concepts covered during the course to analyse episodes of contentious politics.",

        "name": "Effective Managerial Decision Making",
        "description": "Throughout their personal and professional lives, managers have to take multitudes of decisions. The general purpose of this course is to familiarise you with problems associated with unaided managerial decision making, as well as with structured decision aiding techniques aiming to overcome these problems. Students will also obtain an understanding of the thinking processes that underlie judgement and decision making, and its systematic errors and biases.\n\nThe course will be organised in two parts. (1) The first, smaller, part will focus on the psychology of judgement and decision-making. You will be familiarized with psychological research demonstrating that humans have bounded rationality and are susceptible to systematic errors and biases. We will briefly cover the heuristics and biases approach and prospect theory. (2) The second, more substantial, part concerns decision aiding tools. You will be presented with structured decision aiding techniques that aim to improve the quality of managerial decisions in the realm of business as well as public policy. Their core concept is simplification, breaking a complex problem into a number of simpler problems. For each technique, you will be presented with the steps that it involves and how to apply it to real-life problems. We will discuss SMART, planning networks, decision trees, simulation, and financial analysis. We will also discuss how to be more effective in bargaining and negotiation, which is another central activity in management.\n\nBy the end of the course students should have acquired:\n-an in-depth understanding of why unaided decision making is often biased. This involves attaining a good grasp of the psychology of judgement and decision making. Students should also be able to cite and critically evaluate empirical evidence.\n-an understanding of the various decision-aiding techniques including: the contexts in which each technique should be applied, the steps that they involve, and the benefits/shortcomings of each. Importantly, the students should have also acquired the ability to apply such techniques to solve novel problems.\n-an understanding of Raiffa's decision-analytic approach to negotiation, and the ability to apply it to negotiation problems.\n-the ability to read journal articles, understand and discuss the main theoretical points and evidence, and critically evaluate them.",

Legal topics and concepts are used in the course as vehicles to explore legal language. \n\nWhile a selection of legal terminology in each legal topic area is presented throughout the course, mastering legal English requires more than simply improving your knowledge of specialized vocabulary. \n\nBy the end of the course the students should have acquired a basic knowledge of the main features of legal English, aspects of specialized lexis; the importance of legal collocations and formal register, considering different degrees of formality in text types within the large genre of legal English.\n\nThe course is based on the assumption that, in order to profit from the mobility programs/exchanges available in foreign universities, the needs of the students lie predominantly in improving their speaking skills, in addition to listening and reading comprehension strategies; therefore an essential component of the course is learning to produce and deliver an effective oral presentation of a legal topic. \n\nDue to constraints of time, written production and in particular legal drafting is not prioritized, although there are opportunities during the course to practice formal letter-writing, such as emails of advice, replies to letters before action and letters of application/motivation, which are marked and feedback given.\n\nSpecific Learning Outcomes\n\nThis course is focused on improving your language skills at the B2 level. This course will:\nStrengthen speaking skills and enable students to engage more effectively in a range of speaking situations typical of the study of law and the practice of law, such as client interviews or discussions with colleagues and fellow students;\nImprove the ability to read, understand, and applying analyze a range of legal texts, such as legislation and legal correspondence;\nImprove comprehension of spoken English when it is used to speak about legal topics in lectures, presentations, interviews, and discussions appropriate to B2 level; and\nImprove the ability to write basic but accurate legal correspondence.\n\nStudents will also improve their abilities to:\nuse legal language confidently and accurately, based on the knowledge of collocations and specific lexis acquired over the course;\nmake appropriate choices in register, based on the knowledge acquired over the course; and\nuse a range of databases, online dictionaries and legal resources, including an introduction to using linguistic corpora.\n",

A computational model is for this reason not only a virtual reproduction of a natural phenomena that is to be analyzed but also an experimental laboratory where to analyze the effects produced by the mutation on the built model of some causes or structural parameter of the model (material, boundary conditions, geometry fo structures, etc.). The primary objective of the course is to provide the student with the knowledge of the enormous possibilities offered by the computational sceince and at the same time to develop a critical capacity that must enable the engineer to conceive, construct and interpret any computational model.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES:  the course will allow students to\n\u2022\tto recognize the equations of physics that constitute the basic mathematical model of the most important problems of civil engineering and mechanical engineering; \n\u2022\tformulate a problem of the physical mathematics with the variational formulation and/or weak formulations;\n\u2022\tknow the basic steps needed to create a discretized model starting with a weak form of the physical problem;\n\u2022\tinterpret and evaluate the results provided by a computational modeling;\n\u2022\tknow and exploit to deal with the effects of nonlinearity in mechanical structure problems;\n\u2022\tuse computational tools as tools for designing and optimizing structures.\n\n",

        "description": "The vision fostered by the Internet of Things (IoT) rests on the ability to establish untethered and opportunistic communication among devices deployed in the environment or attached to people or other moving entities. Therefore, low-power wireless communication technologies, which remove altogether the need for wires, are a key enabler of IoT. The last few years witnessed a surge of these technologies, striking different tradeoffs in terms of range, data rate, power consumption as well as additional capabilities like distance\nestimation. These technologies enable a plethora of applications, e.g., monitoring and control of physical phenomena (wireless sensor networks) or smart environments where users are automatically localized and able to\nopportunistically interact with objects.\n\nThe course aims at providing students with a first-hand introduction to this exciting field; this is achieved through a synergy of theory and practice.\n\nTraditional classroom lectures will concisely present the salient aspects of several low-power wireless technologies, with an emphasis on wireless sensor networks (a key enabler of many IoT scenarios) and focusing primarily on the networking stack. Instead, laboratory sessions will be the opportunity for students to experiment \"hands-on\" with some of the technologies illustrated in the lectures, and understand their peculiarity.\n\nBy the end of the course, students are expected to have obtained a broad understanding of the key challenges in low-power wireless networking for the IoT, of the state-of-the-art solutions and associated trade-offs, as well as to have acquired the ability to autonomously design relatively simple IoT system components and applications on popular hw/sw platforms.",

        "description": "<p>The psychology of judgment and decision-making is the science that studies the basic mechanisms underlying human judgments and choices. The science originated in the 1970s but reached its peak in 2002, when Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, psychologists, were awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for having integrated results of psychological research into economic science, especially with regard to human judgment and decision theory under conditions of uncertainty. A few years later, Richard Thaler, a behavioral economist and long-time collaborator of Kahneman and Tversky had the idea of using the results of their research to design interventions aimed at improving the well-being of citizens and workers. He summarized his ideas in a book published with Cass Sunstein in 2008 (Nudge). Nudging (gentle pushing) was born, an alternative practice to classic policies, for the conception of which Richard Thaler received the 2017 Nobel Prize in economics. In the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors decided to revise and rewrite the 2008 book. On August 3, 2021, \"Nudge: the final Edition\" was published.</p><p><br></p><p>Today there is a wide spread around the world of Nudge Units (Behavioral Insights Teams).In 2018 the European Union also created a Behavioral Insight Unit. These units collect experimental research findings from various disciplines from behavioral sciences such as behavioral economics to social psychology and cognitive psychology and use them to devise \"behavioral\" interventions that benefit the decision maker. Old-fashioned policies often fail to take into account people's actual behavior. For example, few of us read the entire contract before downloading a new app on our cell phones, and many of us take impulsive actions that we regret later. The behavioral sciences provide empirical evidence to anticipate how people will react to interventions, and they seek to design interventions in ways that make it easier for citizens and workers to make decisions and more closely match their goals. Such nudging interventions have been used to increase savings, reduce consumption, increase health, improve care for the environment, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, you will be able to:</p><p>- develop an understanding of the basic mechanisms of human decision-making.</p><p>- understand how to design behavioral interventions that, by considering these mechanisms, reduce decision fatigue and increase the well-being of citizens and workers.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

Applied Ecology includes natural resource conservation, natural flora and fauna management, water resource management, pest management, pollution and ecotoxycology, natural landscape change, climate change and global warming. Applied ecology and biodiversity study are profoundly intertwined, both in the monitoring phases and in the management choices. The recent and far past clearly shows that technical and engineering choices cannot ignore environmental and ecological sustainability, to avoid the repetition of dramatic disasters like desertification of vast areas, river rectification, Vajont, Stava, Lambro and Danube poisoning, radioactive poisoning in north and south Germany, Tchernobyl and Fukushima, plastic and micro-plastic sea and soil pollution. All these disasters will result in huge costs in environmental, economical terms and they will often directly affect local population health condition. The major causes of the current important economic crisis are due to an environmental crisis that lead to a lack of resources exacerbated by human induced Climate change. This picture was generated by overexploitation and inefficiency in the use of natural resources, caused by the underestimation of the consequences of environmental problems to ecosystem services in an holistic vision. The course will deal with the environments in temperate and boreal climates and with the tropical and subtropical regions. The course will deal with theoretical fundamental elements and practical examples to understand Applied Ecology, giving hints about future developments of this science. Among the topics treated in the course: Ecocertification, biomonitoring, Biosensors, GIS, dynamic landscape modeling, definition of criteria for protected areas planning and management. Species distribution models and prediction of future landscape change with Markov Chains and Cellular automata will be treated. Seminars held by experts and visits to Applied Ecology offices will be organized. The students shall be able to apply Applied Ecology knowledge to understand the consequences of anthropic disturbance on environment and ecosystems. They shall be able to know monitoring field and modeling tools that can help the management of applied ecology. The students will be requested to write an original research paper treating and analyzing a specific topic in a critical perspective.</p>",

Since democracy is a complex concept, which is embodied in often very diverse political systems, it is important to acquire a minimal definition of democracy, and to be able to recognize non-democracies, in order to then explore the many types and models of contemporary democracies. In order to appreciate the complexity and fragility of democracy, it is thirdly necessary to have a detailed picture of the institutions, procedures, processes and mechanisms which ensure a good democratic performance by acquiring a solid and empirically-founded knowledge which guarantees against subscribing to dangerous and ultimately mistaken simplifications. Lastly the course intends to discuss the tensions that derive to democracy from the processes of globalization and Europeanization, that is from the increased interdependence among contemporary democracies particularly in Europe. \nAt the end of the course, students should possess a vocabulary and a conceptual apparatus that allow them to talk about democracy with competence and to use empirically and theoretically founded knowledge to orient themselves in the contemporary political debate.

The course introduces students to this subfield of political science aiming to attain three broad sets of objectives. First, the course aims to offer students a comprehensive set of conceptual and theoretical tools to understand the political dynamics that underpin, and are engendered by, international economic processes. The first part of the course introduces students to the main theoretical approaches to the study of the international political economy, offering an overview of the main contending perspectives on key questions within this field of inquiry (e.g. Who are the main actors? Under what conditions do relevant actors mobilize politically and exert political influence? Which factors facilitate processes of institutionalized international cooperation?). Second, the course aims to familiarize students with both theoretical and normative debates on the politics of international economic relations across six key issue areas: international trade, international monetary relations, international finance, Foreign Direct Investments, foreign aid, and the globalization/nation state nexus. For each of these issue areas, this second part of the course offers 1) an overview of the politics underpinning the patterns of economic exchange that we observe today and throughout history 2) an in-depth analysis of selected seminal theory-driven contributions in the field, and 3) a discussion of the related real-world normative trade-offs. Third, the course aims to train students in a critical reflection of different options for applying theories and methods in the context of simulated \u201creal-world\u201d decision making processes. The activities carried out within the \u201claboratory\u201d section of the course will be instrumental to achieving this aim by 1) training students to write a policy-memo, and 2) simulating a negotiation concerning a particular international political issue.
