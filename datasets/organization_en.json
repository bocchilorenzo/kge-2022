Specific attention is devoted to theological studies and interreligious dialogue.</p>\n\n<p>In the area of <strong>history</strong>, research interests are focused on the <strong>history of institutions and public administration</strong>, <strong>social and communication structures</strong>, the i<strong>nteraction between history and culture</strong>. Particular interest is paid to the Alpine regions and the relationships between the Italian and Germanic worlds. From a more theoretical point of view, specific studies are dedicated to the means of disseminating the historical memory - at individual and collective levels - and to the relationship between historical research and political ideologies.</p>\n\n<p>In the area of cultural heritage, research activities focus on three main strands: <strong>archaeology, history of art, and music</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Language, Philology and Literature</h2>\n\n<p>Research in these areas focuses on texts and their contexts.</p>\n\n<p>As regards languages, the department fosters research in <strong>English, German, French, Russian, and Spanish</strong>, both from a <strong>historical</strong> point of view (the study of literature) and a <strong>synchronic</strong> point of view (the study of spoken languages).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Philology and literature</strong> are closely tied subjects, following the best Italian and European traditions. Research interests are divided in two main areas: the <strong>classical and medieval traditions</strong>, both Latin and vernacular, and <strong>contemporary literature</strong>, explored in a comparative and theoretical perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Two laboratories support research in these areas: one is devoted to the study of European cultural journals (<strong>CIRCE</strong>: Catalogo Informatico delle Riviste Culturali Europee), the other to contemporary poetry studies (<strong>SEMPER</strong>: Seminario Permanente di Poesia). Two journals are published by scholars working in this area: \u201cOsservatorio critico della germanistica\u201d (German studies) and \u201cTicontre\u201d (Theory, Text, Translation).</p>\n\n<p>The department has recently expanded its <strong>course offer</strong>, which now includes 4 undergraduate degrees and 9 master\u2019s degrees. Students also have the opportunity to participate in <strong>training and internship programmes</strong>, spend study periods in other European universities and take the <strong>double degree programme with the University of Dresden</strong>.</p>\n",
